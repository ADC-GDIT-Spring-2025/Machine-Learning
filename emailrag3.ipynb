Mumbai, May 13 (PTI) Maharashtra State Electricity Board (MSEB) has decided not to pick up the remaining 15 per cent equity in Enronpromoted Dabhol Power Company (DPC), which it was earlier supposed to, after the complete construction of the entire USD three billion power project in Dabhol. It is true that we had promised to take the 15 per cent, translating into infusion of around USD 65 million and given the serious financial stress the board is facing, it is not going to be possible for us to participate in the phase II of the project, a senior MSEB official told PTI here Sunday. Currently, Enron International owns 65 per cent, MSEB 15 per cent, General Electric and Bechtel 10 per cent each. However, MSEB is yet to send an official intimation to DPC in this regard, the official said adding the board would inform the company soon after the completion of the project. DPCs USD 1.87 billion phase II would be fired on June seven, 2001, thus marking completion of the 2,184 MW project. DPC, which received a Foreign Investment and Promotion Board clearance in last December for its 10.83 billion foreign Direct Investment, has not been able to scout an alternative fifth partner for MSEBs equity.')],\n",
