What we need to focus on is the first bullet in Allans list; the need for a single set of requirements. Although the meeting with Keith, on Wednesday, was informative the solution of creating a infinitely dynamic consolidated position screen, will be extremely difficult and time consuming. Throughout the meeting on Wednesday, Keith alluded to the inability to get consensus amongst the traders on the presentation of the consolidated position, so the solution was to make it so that a trader can arrange the position screen to their liking (much like Excel). What needs to happen on Monday from 3 5 is a effort to design a desired layout for the consolidated position screen, this is critical.\n",

What we need to focus on is the first bullet in Allans list; the need for a single set of requirements. Although the meeting with Keith, on Wednesday, was informative the solution of creating a infinitely dynamic consolidated position screen, will be extremely difficult and time consuming. Throughout the meeting on Wednesday, Keith alluded to the inability to get consensus amongst the traders on the presentation of the consolidated position, so the solution was to make it so that a trader can arrange the position screen to their liking (much like Excel). What needs to happen on Monday from 3 5 is a effort to design a desired layout for the consolidated position screen, this is critical. This does not exclude building a capability to create a more flexible position presentation for the future, but in order to create a plan that can be measured we need firm requirements. Also, to reiterate that the goals of this project is a project plan on consolidate physicalfinancial positions and transport trade capture. The other issues that have been raised will be capture as projects on to themselves, and will need to be prioritised as efforts outside of this project.\n",

What we need to focus on is the first bullet in Allans list; the need for a single set of requirements. Although the meeting with Keith, on Wednesday, was informative the solution of creating a infinitely dynamic consolidated position screen, will be extremely difficult and time consuming. Throughout the meeting on Wednesday, Keith alluded to the inability to get consensus amongst the traders on the presentation of the consolidated position, so the solution was to make it so that a trader can arrange the position screen to their liking (much like Excel). What needs to happen on Monday from 3 5 is a effort to design a desired layout for the consolidated position screen, this is critical.\n",

It appears that a single buyer entered the marketplace on both September 26 and 27 and paid above market prices (4.704.80) for San Juan gas. At the time of these trades, offers for physical gas at significantly (10 to 15 cents) lower prices were bypassed in order to establish higher trades to report into the index calculation. Additionally, these trades are out of line with the associated financial swaps for San Juan. We have compiled a list of financial and physical trades executed from September 25 to September 27. These are the complete list of trades from Enron Online (EOL), Enrons direct phone conversations, and three brokerage firms (Amerex, APB, and Prebon). Please see the attached spreadsheet for a trade by trade list and a summary.\n",

At the time of these trades, offers for physical gas at significantly (10 to 15 cents) lower prices were bypassed in order to establish higher trades to report into the index calculation. Additionally, these trades are out of line with the associated financial swaps for San Juan. We have compiled a list of financial and physical trades executed from September 25 to September 27.

      "Content: passage: Even if the maximum loan would cover all costs, it is unlikely the bank would allow reimbursement of funds spent. The higher estimates of equity investments are shown in the preliminary proforma to be on the safe side. The engineer is preparing a tentative site layout with an initial evaluation of the phasing, which can significantly reduce the cash equity requirement. Phasing works as follows. If the first phase was say 40 units, the total lot improvement cost might average 31,000 per lot. Of this, probably 13,000 would be for improvements and 19,000 for the land cost. The improvements are higher to cover large one time up front costs for design costs, the entry road, water treatment costs, perimeter fencing and landscaping, and so on, as well as for 100 of the land. The land loan for undeveloped lots would be 70 of the appraised raw lot value, which I would estimate as 10,000 per lot for a loan value of 7,000 per lot. Then the loan value for each improved lot would be 15,000 per lot.\n",

This cost represents a bond for the completion of improvements that COA considers vital and these funds are released once the improvements have been completed and accepted by COA. This release will be for 90 of the cost with the remaining 10 released one year after completion. Releases can be granted once every 90 days and you should expect that the release would occur 6 months after the start of lot improvement construction. These fiscals are usually posted in cash or an irrevocable letter of credit. As such, they have to be counted as a development cost, even though they are not spent. Because they are not spent no interest is charged on these funds. The lot improvement loan is typically 75 of the appraised value of a finished lot, which I suspect will be at least 20,000 and potentially as high as 25,000.\n",

As it is in the Smart Growth Corridor area designated by the City of Austin for preferred development, this will be fast tracked and should be complete in less than 6 months. Additionally, many of the current and more severe water treatment ordinances have been waived. I have estimated the lot improvement costs based on a 28 lot development we investigated in North Austin, which included a detentionretention and filtration pond and street widening. Even though this property is not likely to require street widening and will have less of a detentionretention and filtration pond requirement, I used this data to be cautious.

I have estimated the lot improvement costs based on a 28 lot development we investigated in North Austin, which included a detentionretention and filtration pond and street widening. Even though this property is not likely to require street widening and will have less of a detentionretention and filtration pond requirement, I used this data to be cautious.

      "Content: passage: Data centers, also known as colocation facilities and server farms, are sprouting at such a furious pace in Tukwila and the Kent Valley that some have expressed concern over whether Seattle City Light and Puget Sound Energy can handle the power necessary to run these 24hour, highsecurity facilities. We are talking to about half a dozen customers that are requesting 445 megawatts of power in a little area near Southcenter Mall, said Karl Karzmar, manager of revenue requirements for Puget Sound Energy. That is the equivalent of six oil refineries. A relatively new phenomenon in the utility business, the rise of the Internet data center has some utility veterans scratching their heads. Puget Sound Energy last week asked the Washington Utilities and Transportation Commission to accept a tariff on the new data centers. The tariff is designed to protect the companys existing residential and business customers from footing the bill for the new base stations necessary to support the projects. Those base stations could cost as much as 20 million each, Karzmar said.\n",

      "Content: passage: Sabey Corp. repurchased the 1.35 million squarefoot Intergate East facility last September from Boeing Space & Defense. In less than 12 months, the developer has leased 92 percent of the sixbuilding complex to seven different colocation companies. It is probably the largest data center park in the country, boasts Laurent Poole, chief operating officer at Sabey. Exodus, ICG Communications, NetStream Communications, Pac West Telecomm and Zama Networks all lease space in the office park. After building Exodus first Tukwila facility in 1997, Sabey has become an expert in the arena and now has facilities either under management or development in Los Angeles, Spokane and Denver. Poole claims his firm is one of the top four builders of Internet data centers in the country. As more people access the Internet and conduct bandwidthheavy tasks such as listening to online music, Poole said the need for colocation space in Seattle continues to escalate. But it is not just Seattle. The need for data center space is growing at a rapid clip at many technology hubs throughout the country, causing similar concerns among utilities in places such as Texas and California.\n",

      "Content: passage: Clay Basin storagethis is really a FYI more than anything elseI see five different tickets in Sitara for Clay Basin activityone appears to be for withdrawals and the other four are injections. Clay Basin is valued as a Questar curve, which is substantially below NWPL points. What this means is that any time you are injecting gas, these tickets will show transport losses; each time you are withdrawing, you will show big gains on transport. Im not sure of the best way to handle this since we dont really have a systematic Sitara way of handling storage deals. In an ideal world, it seems that you would map it the way you have it today, but during injection times, the transport cost would pass through as storage costs. Anyway, heres the detail on the tickets just for your info, plus I noticed three days where it appears we were both withdrawing and injecting from Clay Basin.

I base this belief in large part on what I heard at a luncheon I attended yesterday afternoon at which the keynote speaker was FERC Chairman Curt Hebert. Although the Chairman began his presentation by expressly stating that he would not comment or answer questions on pending proceedings before the Commission, Hebert had some enlightening comments which relate to price caps: Price caps are almost never the right answer Price Caps will have the effect of prolonging shortages Competitive choices for consumers is the right answer Any solution, however short term, that does not increase supply or reduce demand, is not acceptable Eight out of eleven western Governors oppose price caps, in that they would export Californias problems to the West This is the latest intelligence I have on the matter, and its a pretty strong anti price cap position.

      "Content: passage: Although the Chairman began his presentation by expressly stating that he would not comment or answer questions on pending proceedings before the Commission, Hebert had some enlightening comments which relate to price caps: Price caps are almost never the right answer Price Caps will have the effect of prolonging shortages Competitive choices for consumers is the right answer Any solution, however short term, that does not increase supply or reduce demand, is not acceptable Eight out of eleven western Governors oppose price caps, in that they would export Californias problems to the West This is the latest intelligence I have on the matter, and its a pretty strong anti price cap position. Of course, Hebert is just one Commissioner out of 3 currently on the Commission, but he controls the meeting agenda and if the draft order is not to his liking, the item could be bumped off the agenda. Hope this info helps.

I would suggest holding the business plan meetings here then take a trip without any formal business meetings. I would even try and get some honest opinions on whether a trip is even desired or necessary. As far as the business meetings, I think it would be more productive to try and stimulate discussions across the different groups about what is working and what is not. Too often the presenter speaks and the others are quiet just waiting for their turn. The meetings might be better if held in a round table discussion format. My suggestion for where to go is Austin.

      "Content: passage: I base this belief in large part on what I heard at a luncheon I attended yesterday afternoon at which the keynote speaker was FERC Chairman Curt Hebert. Although the Chairman began his presentation by expressly stating that he would not comment or answer questions on pending proceedings before the Commission, Hebert had some enlightening comments which relate to price caps: Price caps are almost never the right answer Price Caps will have the effect of prolonging shortages Competitive choices for consumers is the right answer Any solution, however short term, that does not increase supply or reduce demand, is not acceptable Eight out of eleven western Governors oppose price caps, in that they would export Californias problems to the West This is the latest intelligence I have on the matter, and its a pretty strong anti price cap position. Of course, Hebert is just one Commissioner out of 3 currently on the Commission, but he controls the meeting agenda and if the draft order is not to his liking, the item could be bumped off the agenda. Hope this info helps.

Employees who work for business units that are scheduled to move to the new building and currently park in the Allen Center or Met garages are being offered a parking space in the new Enron Center garage. This is the only offer you will receive during the initial migration to the new garage. Spaces will be filled on a first come first served basis. The cost for the new garage will be the same as Allen Center garage which is currently 165.00 per month, less the company subsidy, leaving a monthly employee cost of 94.00. If you choose not to accept this offer at this time, you may add your name to the Enron Center garage waiting list at a later day and offers will be made as spaces become available.\n",

Employees who work for business units that are scheduled to move to the new building and currently park in the Allen Center or Met garages are being offered a parking space in the new Enron Center garage. This is the only offer you will receive during the initial migration to the new garage. Spaces will be filled on a first come first served basis. The cost for the new garage will be the same as Allen Center garage which is currently 165.00 per month, less the company subsidy, leaving a monthly employee cost of 94.00. If you choose not to accept this offer at this time, you may add your name to the Enron Center garage waiting list at a later day and offers will be made as spaces become available. The Saturn Ring that connects the garage and both buildings will not be opened until summer 2001. All initial parkers will have to use the street level entrance to Enron Center North until Saturn Ring access is available. Garage stairways next to the elevator lobbies at each floor may be used as an exit in the event of elevator trouble.\n",

According to BPA, it had excess energy to sell as a result of running water to meet biological opinion flow standards, but it has stopped doing so in order to allow reservoirs to fill from runoff. The agency said it had been telling Californias Department of Water Resources that the sales could cease at any time, and this morning they ended. CalISO reported about 1,600 MW less imports today than yesterday, so it appears other sellers have also cut back. Yesterday, PowerEx said it was not selling into California because of concerns about its water reserves. BPA said it is still sending exchange energy into California, however. More details, if available, will be included in the Friday edition of the Western Price Survey and in California Energy Markets newsletter.\n",

For the first, we feel that at least 25, or 350,000, of the minimum 1.4MM fee has been earned to date.? For the second, in your prior correspondence you valued our time at 500,000 per year, which would mean this period was worth 208,333.? Either of these valuations seem quite fair and reasonable, especially as neither includes the forfeit of our 40 interest in the project worth 0.81.2MM. ?However, in the hope that we can maintain a good relationship with the prospect of future projects, we are willing to accept only a small monthly fee of 15,000 per month to cover a portion of our direct time and overhead.? As shown in the attached table, this fee, plus cash outlays and less accrued interest brings the total net buyout to 78,946.? We still believe that this project needs the professional services that we offer and have provided.?\n",

For the second, in your prior correspondence you valued our time at 500,000 per year, which would mean this period was worth 208,333.? Either of these valuations seem quite fair and reasonable, especially as neither includes the forfeit of our 40 interest in the project worth 0.81.2MM. ?However, in the hope that we can maintain a good relationship with the prospect of future projects, we are willing to accept only a small monthly fee of 15,000 per month to cover a portion of our direct time and overhead.? As shown in the attached table, this fee, plus cash outlays and less accrued interest brings the total net buyout to 78,946.? We still believe that this project needs the professional services that we offer and have provided.? However, if you accept the terms of this buyout offer, which we truly feel is quite fair and reasonable, then, we are prepared to be bought out and leave this extraordinary project to you both.?

The principal change is in the addition of masonry on the front of the buildings, which I estimate will costs at least 84,000 additional. Also, the trim material and labor costs have been increased. I still believe that the total cost is more than sufficient, but there will be additional updates. The managers unit is columns JL, but the total is not included in the B&N total of rentable units. Rather, the total cost for the managers unit and office is included as a lump sum under amenities. I may add this back in as a rentable unit and delete is as an amenity. The financing cost has been changed in that the cost of the permanent mortgage has been deleted because we will not need to obtain this for the construction loan approval, therefore, its cost will be absorbed when this loan is obtained. Based on either a loan equal to 75 of value or 80 of cost, the construction profit should cover any equity required beyond the land.\n",

I had at least 5 people here past midnight on both nights and I have several people who have not left before 10:30 this week. 2.) It is my understanding that Susan was still booking new day deals on Thursday night at 8:30 bc she did not get deal tickets from the trading floor until after 5:00 p.m. 3.) It is also my understanding that Susan is done with the p&l and benchmark part of her book often times by 6:00, but that what keeps her here late is usually running numerous extra models and spreadsheets. (One suggestion might be a permanent IT person on this book.) (This was also my understanding from Kyle Etter, who has left the company.) I would like to get this resolved as soon as possible so that Larry can get the information that he needs to be effective and so that we can run books like this and not lose good people. Thanks Larry May@ENRON 02022001 02:43 PM To: Sally BeckHOUECT@ECT, Jeffrey C GossettHOUECT@ECT, Susan M ScottHOUECT@ECT, Errol McLaughlinCorpEnron@ENRON cc: Phillip K AllenHOUECT@ECT, John ArnoldHOUECT@ECT Subject: re: book admin for PipeGas daily option book As you might be aware, Susan Scott (the book admin for the pipe option book) was forced by system problems to stay all night Wednesday night and until 200 am Friday in order to calc my book. While she is scheduled to rotate to the West desk soon, I think we need to discuss putting two persons on my book in order to bring the work load to a sustainable level. Id like to meet at 2:30 pm on Monday to discuss this issue. Please let me know if this time fits in your schedules. Thanks, Larry\n",

As Gary and Wade continue to improve the property, I need you to try and improve the propertys tenants and reputation. The apartments are looking better and better, yet the turnover seems to be increasing. Remember that as a manager you need to set the example for the tenants. It is hard to tell tenants that they are not supposed to have extra people move in that are not on the lease, when the manager has a houseful of guests. I realize you have had a lot of issues with taking your son to the doctor and your daughter being a teenager, but you need to put in 40 hours and be working in the office or on the property during office unless you are running an errand for the property.\n",

The ISO is having to compete with investorowned utilities in the Northwest that are willing to pay higher prices for power in a region where there are no price caps. The ISO warned federal regulators, generators and utilities Wednesday during a conference call that it would call a stagethree power emergency Wednesday, but wouldnt order rolling blackouts. A stage three is declared when the ISOs operating reserves fall to less than 1.5 and power is interrupted on a statewide basis to keep the grid from collapsing. But ISO spokesman Patrick Dorinson said it would call a stage three only as a means of attracting additional electricity resources. In order to line up (more power) we have to be in a dire situation, Dorinson said.

      "Content: passage: Thomas, as well as an ISO spokesman, didnt know whether the representatives returned Wednesday for a full inspection. AES Units Down Due To Expired Emissions Credits The Huntington Beach facility and units at two other AES facilities have used up their nitrogen oxide, or NOx, emission credits. They were taken down two weeks ago in response to a request by the South Coast Air Quality Management District to stay off line until emissions controls are deployed, Thomas said. AES has about 2,000 MW, or half its maximum output, off line. The entire Huntington plant is off line, as is 1,500 MW worth of units at its Alamitos and Redondo Beach plants. The ISO has asked AES to return its off line plants to operations, but AES has refused because it is concerned the air quality district will fine the company 20 million for polluting. Wed be happy to put our units back, provided we dont get sued for it, Thomas said. Its not clear to us that the ISO trumps the air quality districts authority. As reported, a spokesman for the air quality district said Tuesday that AES could have elected to buy more emission credits so that it could run its off line plants in case of power emergencies, but choose not to do so.

      "Content: passage: TURN Proposal As part of our review, the CPUC asked that we comment on the proposal of TU RN20 to change certain aspects of the regulatory accounting for transition asset s.20 Our comments are summarized as follows: The Proposal would have no direct impact on the cash flows of SCE in that i t20 would not directly generate nor use cash. The Proposal01,s impact on SCE01,s balance sheet would initially be to sh ift20 costs between two regulatory assets. TURN01,s proposal recognizes that because the costs of procuring power and the20 revenues from generating power are tracked separately, the undercollection in20 the TRA is overstated. VI. Flow of Funds Analysis Highlights: In the last five years, SCE had generated net income of 2.7 billion and a 20 positive cash flow from operations of 7 billion. During the same time period, SCE paid dividends and other distributions to 20 its parent, Edison International, of approximately 4.8 billion. Edison International used the funds from dividends to pay dividends to its 20 shareholders of 1.6 billion and repurchased shares of its outstanding comm on20 stock of 2.7 billion, with the remaining funds being used for administrati ve20 and general costs, investments, and other corporate purposes. there is no Section VII 20 VIII. Earnings of California Affiliates SCE01,s payments for power to its affiliates were approximately 400500 20 million annually and remained relatively stable from 1996 through 1999.20 In 2000, the payments increased by approximately 50 to over 600 million. 20 This increase correlates to the increase in market prices for natural gas for the same period.\n",

Check my math, but it looks like all the builders profit would be recouped in the first year of operation. At permanent financing 1.1 would be paid, leaving only .3 to pay out in the 1st year. Since almost 80 of builders profit is repaid at the same time as the investment, I feel the 6535 is a fair split.
