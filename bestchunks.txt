Content: passage: Traveling to have a business meeting takes the fun out of the trip. Especially if you have to prepare a presentation. I would suggest holding the business plan meetings here then take a trip without any formal business meetings. I would even try and get some honest opinions on whether a trip is even desired or necessary. As far as the business meetings, I think it would be more productive to try and stimulate discussions across the different groups about what is working and what is not. Too often the presenter speaks and the others are quiet just waiting for their turn. The meetings might be better if held in a round table discussion format.

Content: passage: What we need to focus on is the first bullet in Allans list; the need for a single set of requirements. Although the meeting with Keith, on Wednesday, was informative the solution of creating a infinitely dynamic consolidated position screen, will be extremely difficult and time consuming. Throughout the meeting on Wednesday, Keith alluded to the inability to get consensus amongst the traders on the presentation of the consolidated position, so the solution was to make it so that a trader can arrange the position screen to their liking (much like Excel). What needs to happen on Monday from 3 5 is a effort to design a desired layout for the consolidated position screen, this is critical. This does not exclude building a capability to create a more flexible position presentation for the future, but in order to create a plan that can be measured we need firm requirements.

What we need to focus on is the first bullet in Allans list; the need for a single set of requirements. Although the meeting with Keith, on Wednesday, was informative the solution of creating a infinitely dynamic consolidated position screen, will be extremely difficult and time consuming.

Content: passage: What we need to focus on is the first bullet in Allans list; the need for a single set of requirements. Although the meeting with Keith, on Wednesday, was informative the solution of creating a infinitely dynamic consolidated position screen, will be extremely difficult and time consuming. Throughout the meeting on Wednesday, Keith alluded to the inability to get consensus amongst the traders on the presentation of the consolidated position, so the solution was to make it so that a trader can arrange the position screen to their liking (much like Excel). What needs to happen on Monday from 3 5 is a effort to design a desired layout for the consolidated position screen, this is critical. This does not exclude building a capability to create a more flexible position presentation for the future, but in order to create a plan that can be measured we need firm requirements.

San Marcos The property across the street from the Sagewood units in San Marcos is for sale and approved for 134 units. The land is selling for 2.50 per square foot as it is one of only two remaining approved multifamily parcels in West San Marcos, which now has a moratorium on development. Several new studies we have looked at show that the rents for our duplexes and for these new units are going to be significantly higher, roughly 1.25 per square foot if leased for the entire unit on a 12month lease and 1.301.40 psf if leased on a 12month term, but by individual room. This property will have the best location for student housing of all new projects, just as the duplexes do now.

Content: passage: Forwarded by Phillip K AllenHOUECT on 09282000 01:09 PM From: Phillip K Allen 09282000 10:56 AM Liane, As we discussed yesterday, I am concerned there may have been an attempt to manipulate the El Paso San Juan monthly index. It appears that a single buyer entered the marketplace on both September 26 and 27 and paid above market prices (4.704.80) for San Juan gas. At the time of these trades, offers for physical gas at significantly (10 to 15 cents) lower prices were bypassed in order to establish higher trades to report into the index calculation. Additionally, these trades are out of line with the associated financial swaps for San Juan. We have compiled a list of financial and physical trades executed from September 25 to September 27.

Content: passage: As we discussed yesterday, I am concerned there has been an attempt to manipulate the El Paso San Juan monthly index. A single buyer entered the marketplace on both September 26 and 27 and paid above market prices (4.704.80) for San Juan gas with the intent to distort the index. At the time of these trades, offers for physical gas at significantly (10 to 15 cents) lower prices were bypassed in order to establish higher trades to report into the index calculation. Additionally, these trades are out of line with the associated financial swaps for San Juan. We have compiled a list of financial and physical trades executed from September 25 to September 27.

EQUITY AT IMPROVEMENT LOAN Once the site plan is approved by the City of Austin, the City will require the development entity to post funds for fiscal improvements, referred to as the fiscals. This cost represents a bond for the completion of improvements that COA considers vital and these funds are released once the improvements have been completed and accepted by COA. This release will be for 90 of the cost with the remaining 10 released one year after completion.

Content: passage: As such, they have to be counted as a development cost, even though they are not spent. Because they are not spent no interest is charged on these funds. The lot improvement loan is typically 75 of the appraised value of a finished lot, which I suspect will be at least 20,000 and potentially as high as 25,000. This would produce a loan amount of 15,000 on 20,000 per lot. With estimated per lot improvement costs of 9,000, fiscals at 2,000 and the land cost at 8,000 , total improved lot cost is 19,000 which means 0 to 4,000 per lot in total equity. The investment prior to obtaining the improvement loan would count towards any equity requirement provided it was for direct costs.

Content: passage: The investment prior to obtaining the improvement loan would count towards any equity requirement provided it was for direct costs. Thus, the additional equity for the improvement loan would be 0184,000. Even if the maximum loan would cover all costs, it is unlikely the bank would allow reimbursement of funds spent. The higher estimates of equity investments are shown in the preliminary proforma to be on the safe side.

Content: passage: The engineer is preparing a tentative site layout with an initial evaluation of the phasing, which can significantly reduce the cash equity requirement. Phasing works as follows. If the first phase was say 40 units, the total lot improvement cost might average 31,000 per lot. Of this, probably 13,000 would be for improvements and 19,000 for the land cost. The improvements are higher to cover large one time up front costs for design costs, the entry road, water treatment costs, perimeter fencing and landscaping, and so on, as well as for 100 of the land.

The improvements are higher to cover large one time up front costs for design costs, the entry road, water treatment costs, perimeter fencing and landscaping, and so on, as well as for 100 of the land. The land loan for undeveloped lots would be 70 of the appraised raw lot value, which I would estimate as 10,000 per lot for a loan value of 7,000 per lot. Then the loan value for each improved lot would be 15,000 per lot. This would give you a total loan of 992,000, total cost of 1,232,645 for equity required of 241,000.

Content: passage: CONSTRUCTION LOANS There are three types of construction loans. First, is a speculative (spec) loan that is taken out prior to any presales activity. Second, is a construction loan for a presold unit, but the loan remains in the builderdevelopers name. Third, is a presold unit with the construction loan in the name of the buyer. We expect to have up to 8 spec loans to start the project and expect all other loans to be presold units with loans in the name of the builderdeveloper. We do not expect to have any construction loans in the name of the buyers, as such loans are too difficult to manage and please new buyers unfamiliar with the process. Spec loans will be for 70 to 75 of value and construction loans for presold units, if the construction loan is from the mortgage lender, will be from 80 to 95 of value. DISBURSEMENTS Disbursements will be handled by the General Partner to cover current and near term third party costs, then to necessary reserves, then to priority payments and then to the partners per the agreement. The General Partner will contract with Creekside Builders, LLC to construct the units and the fee to CB will include a construction management and overhead fee equal to 15 of the direct hard cost excluding land, financing and sales costs.

These fees are the only monies to Creekside, Larry Lewter or myself prior to calculation of profit, except for a) direct reimbursement for partnership expenses and b) direct payment to CB for any subcontractor costs that it has to perform. For example, if CB cannot find a good trim carpenter sub, or cannot find enough trim carpenters, etc., and it decides to undertake this function, it will charge the partnership the same fee it was able to obtain from third parties and will disclose those cases to the partnership. Finally, CB will receive a fee for the use of any of its equipment if it is used in lieu of leasing equipment from others.

Content: passage: All loans for residential construction, that are intended for resale, are full recourse loans. If we are pursuing multifamily rental developments, the construction loans are still full recourse but the mortgage can often be nonrecourse. USE OF INITIAL INVESTMENT The initial investment is used for land deposit, engineering & architectural design, soils tests, surveys, filing fees, legal fees for organization and condominium association formation, and appraisals.

EARLY LAND COSTS The 4,000 per month costs listed in the cash flow as part of land cost represent the extension fees due to the seller for up to 4 months of extensions on closing. As an alternative, we can close into a land loan at probably 70 of appraised value. With a land value equal to the purchase price of 680,000 this would mean a land loan of 476,000 with estimated monthly interest payments of 3,966, given a 10 annual interest rate, plus approximately 1.25 of the loan amount for closing costs and loan fees.

EQUITY AT IMPROVEMENT LOAN Once the site plan is approved by the City of Austin, the City will require the development entity to post funds for fiscal improvements, referred to as the fiscals. This cost represents a bond for the completion of improvements that COA considers vital and these funds are released once the improvements have been completed and accepted by COA. This release will be for 90 of the cost with the remaining 10 released one year after completion.

Content: passage: As such, they have to be counted as a development cost, even though they are not spent. Because they are not spent no interest is charged on these funds. The lot improvement loan is typically 75 of the appraised value of a finished lot, which I suspect will be at least 20,000 and potentially as high as 25,000. This would produce a loan amount of 15,000 on 20,000 per lot. With estimated per lot improvement costs of 9,000, fiscals at 2,000 and the land cost at 8,000 , total improved lot cost is 19,000 which means 0 to 4,000 per lot in total equity. The investment prior to obtaining the improvement loan would count towards any equity requirement provided it was for direct costs. Thus, the additional equity for the improvement loan would be 0184,000.

Content: passage: The engineer is preparing a tentative site layout with an initial evaluation of the phasing, which can significantly reduce the cash equity requirement. Phasing works as follows. If the first phase was say 40 units, the total lot improvement cost might average 31,000 per lot. Of this, probably 13,000 would be for improvements and 19,000 for the land cost. The improvements are higher to cover large one time up front costs for design costs, the entry road, water treatment costs, perimeter fencing and landscaping, and so on, as well as for 100 of the land.

The improvements are higher to cover large one time up front costs for design costs, the entry road, water treatment costs, perimeter fencing and landscaping, and so on, as well as for 100 of the land. The land loan for undeveloped lots would be 70 of the appraised raw lot value, which I would estimate as 10,000 per lot for a loan value of 7,000 per lot. Then the loan value for each improved lot would be 15,000 per lot. This would give you a total loan of 992,000, total cost of 1,232,645 for equity required of 241,000.

Content: passage: CONSTRUCTION LOANS There are three types of construction loans. First, is a speculative (spec) loan that is taken out prior to any presales activity. Second, is a construction loan for a presold unit, but the loan remains in the builderdevelopers name. Third, is a presold unit with the construction loan in the name of the buyer. We expect to have up to 8 spec loans to start the project and expect all other loans to be presold units with loans in the name of the builderdeveloper. We do not expect to have any construction loans in the name of the buyers, as such loans are too difficult to manage and please new buyers unfamiliar with the process. Spec loans will be for 70 to 75 of value and construction loans for presold units, if the construction loan is from the mortgage lender, will be from 80 to 95 of value. DISBURSEMENTS Disbursements will be handled by the General Partner to cover current and near term third party costs, then to necessary reserves, then to priority payments and then to the partners per the agreement. The General Partner will contract with Creekside Builders, LLC to construct the units and the fee to CB will include a construction management and overhead fee equal to 15 of the direct hard cost excluding land, financing and sales costs.
