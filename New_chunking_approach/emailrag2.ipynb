Although the meeting with Keith, on Wednesday, was informative the solution of creating a infinitely dynamic consolidated position screen, will be extremely difficult and time consuming. Throughout the meeting on Wednesday, Keith alluded to the inability to get consensus amongst the traders on the presentation of the consolidated position, so the solution was to make it so that a trader can arrange the position screen to their liking (much like Excel). What needs to happen on Monday from 3 5 is a effort to design a desired layout for the consolidated position screen, this is critical. This does not exclude building a capability to create a more flexible position presentation for the future, but in order to create a plan that can be measured we need firm requirements.\n",

Although the meeting with Keith, on Wednesday, was informative the solution of creating a infinitely dynamic consolidated position screen, will be extremely difficult and time consuming. Throughout the meeting on Wednesday, Keith alluded to the inability to get consensus amongst the traders on the presentation of the consolidated position, so the solution was to make it so that a trader can arrange the position screen to their liking (much like Excel). What needs to happen on Monday from 3 5 is a effort to design a desired layout for the consolidated position screen, this is critical. This does not exclude building a capability to create a more flexible position presentation for the future, but in order to create a plan that can be measured we need firm requirements.\n",

It appears that a single buyer entered the marketplace on both September 26 and 27 and paid above market prices (4.704.80) for San Juan gas. At the time of these trades, offers for physical gas at significantly (10 to 15 cents) lower prices were bypassed in order to establish higher trades to report into the index calculation. Additionally, these trades are out of line with the associated financial swaps for San Juan. We have compiled a list of financial and physical trades executed from September 25 to September 27.\n",

      "Content: passage: As we discussed yesterday, I am concerned there has been an attempt to manipulate the El Paso San Juan monthly index. A single buyer entered the marketplace on both September 26 and 27 and paid above market prices (4.704.80) for San Juan gas with the intent to distort the index. At the time of these trades, offers for physical gas at significantly (10 to 15 cents) lower prices were bypassed in order to establish higher trades to report into the index calculation. Additionally, these trades are out of line with the associated financial swaps for San Juan. We have compiled a list of financial and physical trades executed from September 25 to September 27.\n",

      "Content: passage: As such, they have to be counted as a development cost, even though they are not spent. Because they are not spent no interest is charged on these funds. The lot improvement loan is typically 75 of the appraised value of a finished lot, which I suspect will be at least 20,000 and potentially as high as 25,000. This would produce a loan amount of 15,000 on 20,000 per lot. With estimated per lot improvement costs of 9,000, fiscals at 2,000 and the land cost at 8,000 , total improved lot cost is 19,000 which means 0 to 4,000 per lot in total equity. The investment prior to obtaining the improvement loan would count towards any equity requirement provided it was for direct costs. Thus, the additional equity for the improvement loan would be 0184,000.\n",

Phasing works as follows. If the first phase was say 40 units, the total lot improvement cost might average 31,000 per lot. Of this, probably 13,000 would be for improvements and 19,000 for the land cost. The improvements are higher to cover large one time up front costs for design costs, the entry road, water treatment costs, perimeter fencing and landscaping, and so on, as well as for 100 of the land.\n",

These fees are the only monies to Creekside, Larry Lewter or myself prior to calculation of profit, except for a) direct reimbursement for partnership expenses and b) direct payment to CB for any subcontractor costs that it has to perform. For example, if CB cannot find a good trim carpenter sub, or cannot find enough trim carpenters, etc., and it decides to undertake this function, it will charge the partnership the same fee it was able to obtain from third parties and will disclose those cases to the partnership. Finally, CB will receive a fee for the use of any of its equipment if it is used in lieu of leasing equipment from others.\n",

This is the best project in terms of risk and reward that we have uncovered to date in the Austin market. The project does have approved zoning and will only require a site plan. As it is in the Smart Growth Corridor area designated by the City of Austin for preferred development, this will be fast tracked and should be complete in less than 6 months. Additionally, many of the current and more severe water treatment ordinances have been waived. I have estimated the lot improvement costs based on a 28 lot development we investigated in North Austin, which included a detentionretention and filtration pond and street widening. Even though this property is not likely to require street widening and will have less of a detentionretention and filtration pond requirement, I used this data to be cautious.

I regret that it took so long to get back to you, but we had some unusual events these past few weeks. A small freakish wind storm with severe 60mpg downdrafts hit the South part of Austin where we are building 10 town homes. One of these units had just had the roof decked with the siding scheduled to start the next day. The severe downdraft hitting the decked roof was enough to knock it down.\n",

      "Content: passage: A relatively new phenomenon in the utility business, the rise of the Internet data center has some utility veterans scratching their heads. Puget Sound Energy last week asked the Washington Utilities and Transportation Commission to accept a tariff on the new data centers. The tariff is designed to protect the companys existing residential and business customers from footing the bill for the new base stations necessary to support the projects. Those base stations could cost as much as 20 million each, Karzmar said. Not to be left behind, Seattle City Light plans to bring up the data center issue on Thursday at the Seattle City Council meeting. For the utilities that provide power to homes, businesses and schools in the region, this is a new and complex issue.\n",

I base this belief in large part on what I heard at a luncheon I attended yesterday afternoon at which the keynote speaker was FERC Chairman Curt Hebert. Although the Chairman began his presentation by expressly stating that he would not comment or answer questions on pending proceedings before the Commission, Hebert had some enlightening comments which relate to price caps: Price caps are almost never the right answer Price Caps will have the effect of prolonging shortages Competitive choices for consumers is the right answer Any solution, however short term, that does not increase supply or reduce demand, is not acceptable Eight out of eleven western Governors oppose price caps, in that they would export Californias problems to the West This is the latest intelligence I have on the matter, and its a pretty strong anti price cap position. Of course, Hebert is just one Commissioner out of 3 currently on the Commission, but he controls the meeting agenda and if the draft order is not to his liking, the item could be bumped off the agenda. Hope this info helps.\n",

Senator Bowens language states that the state should get paid before the utilities from rate payments (which, if passed, would be likely to cause a SoCal bankruptcy). According to sources close to the Republicans in the legislature, Republicans do not believe there should be a bridge loan due to money available in the General Fund. For instance, Tony Strickland has stated that only 12 of the bonds (or approximately 5 billion) should be issued. Other Republicans reportedly do not support issuing any bonds.\n",

I would suggest holding the business plan meetings here then take a trip without any formal business meetings. I would even try and get some honest opinions on whether a trip is even desired or necessary. As far as the business meetings, I think it would be more productive to try and stimulate discussions across the different groups about what is working and what is not. Too often the presenter speaks and the others are quiet just waiting for their turn. The meetings might be better if held in a round table discussion format.\n",

      "The San Juan index distortion refers to a phenomenon where the apparent shape and size of objects can become distorted when viewed from certain angles or perspectives, particularly in areas with unique geological features such as the San Juan Mountains in Colorado. This distortion can be caused by a combination of factors including the Earth's slightly ellipsoidal shape, the effects of atmospheric refraction, and the way our brains process visual information.\n",
