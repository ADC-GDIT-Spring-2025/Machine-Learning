To do so I need a corresponding term gas price for same. Microturbine is an onsite generation product developed by Honeywell to generate electricity on customer site (degen). using natural gas. In doing so, I need your best fixed price forward gas price deal for 1, 3, 5, 7 and 10 years for annualseasonal supply to microturbines to generate fixed kWh for customer. We have the opportunity to sell customer kWh s using microturbine or sell them turbines themselves. kWh deal must have limited no risk forward gas price to make deal work. Therein comes Sempra energy gas trading, truly you. We are proposing installing 180 240 units across a large number of stores (60100) in San Diego. Store number varies because of installation hurdles face at small percent. For 68 hours a day Microturbine run time: Gas requirement for 180 microturbines 227 302 MMcf per year Gas requirement for 240 microturbines 302 403 MMcf per year Gas will likely be consumed from May through September, during peak electric period.

Investors Alliance says that these demographics are similar to the package on San Marcos that you received earlier. If there are any other questions or information requirements, let me know. Then, let me know your interest level in the Westgate project? San Marcos The property across the street from the Sagewood units in San Marcos is for sale and approved for 134 units. The land is selling for 2.50 per square foot as it is one of only two remaining approved multifamily parcels in West San Marcos, which now has a moratorium on development. Several new studies we have looked at show that the rents for our duplexes and for these new units are going to be significantly higher, roughly 1.25 per square foot if leased for the entire unit on a 12month lease and 1.301.40 psf if leased on a 12month term, but by individual room. This property will have the best location for student housing of all new projects, just as the duplexes do now. If this project is of serious interest to you, please let me know as there is a very, very short window of opportunity. The equity requirement is not yet known, but it would be likely to be 300,000 to secure the land.

The General Partner owns 1 of the project and carries the liability of construction.' metadata={'sender': 'phillip.allen@enron.com', 'recipient': 'kholst@enron.com', 'date': 'Tue, 26 Sep 2000 09:28:00 -0700', 'subject': 'Investment Structure'}\n",
      "page_content='passage: LAND OWNERSHIP & LOANS The property would be purchased in the name of the limited partnership and any land loans, land improvements loans and construction loans would be in the name of the limited partnership. Each of the individual investors and all of the principals in Creekside would also personally guarantee the loans. If the investor(s) do not sign on the loans, this generally means that a larger amount of cash is required and the investors share of profits is reduced. All loans for residential construction, that are intended for resale, are full recourse loans. If we are pursuing multifamily rental developments, the construction loans are still full recourse but the mortgage can often be nonrecourse. USE OF INITIAL INVESTMENT The initial investment is used for land deposit, engineering & architectural design, soils tests, surveys, filing fees, legal fees for organization and condominium association formation, and appraisals. Unlike many real estate investment programs, none of the funds are used for fees to Creekside Builders, LLC. These professional expenses will be incurred over the estimated 6 month design and approval period. EARLY LAND COSTS The 4,000 per month costs listed in the cash flow as part of land cost represent the extension fees due to the seller for up to 4 months of extensions on closing. As an alternative, we can close into a land loan at probably 70 of appraised value. With a land value equal to the purchase price of 680,000 this would mean a land loan of 476,000 with estimated monthly interest payments of 3,966, given a 10 annual interest rate, plus approximately 1.25 of the loan amount for closing costs and loan fees. EQUITY AT IMPROVEMENT LOAN Once the site plan is approved by the City of Austin, the City will require the development entity to post funds for fiscal improvements, referred to as the fiscals. This cost represents a bond for the completion of improvements that COA considers vital and these funds are released once the improvements have been completed and accepted by COA. This release will be for 90 of the cost with the remaining 10 released one year after completion. Releases can be granted once every 90 days and you should expect that the release would occur 6 months after the start of lot improvement construction. These fiscals are usually posted in cash or an irrevocable letter of credit. As such, they have to be counted as a development cost, even though they are not spent. Because they are not spent no interest is charged on these funds. The lot improvement loan is typically 75 of the appraised value of a finished lot, which I suspect will be at least 20,000 and potentially as high as 25,000. This would produce a loan amount of 15,000 on 20,000 per lot. With estimated per lot improvement costs of 9,000, fiscals at 2,000 and the land cost at 8,000 , total improved lot cost is 19,000 which means 0 to 4,000 per lot in total equity. The investment prior to obtaining the improvement loan would count towards any equity requirement provided it was for direct costs. Thus, the additional equity for the improvement loan would be 0184,000. Even if the maximum loan would cover all costs, it is unlikely the bank would allow reimbursement of funds spent. The higher estimates of equity investments are shown in the preliminary proforma to be on the safe side. The engineer is preparing a tentative site layout with an initial evaluation of the phasing, which can significantly reduce the cash equity requirement. Phasing works as follows. If the first phase was say 40 units, the total lot improvement cost might average 31,000 per lot. Of this, probably 13,000 would be for improvements and 19,000 for the land cost. The improvements are higher to cover large one time up front costs for design costs, the entry road, water treatment costs, perimeter fencing and landscaping, and so on, as well as for 100 of the land. The land loan for undeveloped lots would be 70 of the appraised raw lot value, which I would estimate as 10,000 per lot for a loan value of 7,000 per lot. Then the loan value for each improved lot would be 15,000 per lot. This would give you a total loan of 992,000, total cost of 1,232,645 for equity required of 241,000. This was not presented in the initial analysis as the phasing is depended on a more careful assessment by the Civil Engineer as the separate phases must each be able to stand on its own from a utility standpoint. CONSTRUCTION LOANS There are three types of construction loans. First, is a speculative (spec) loan that is taken out prior to any presales activity. Second, is a construction loan for a presold unit, but the loan remains in the builderdevelopers name. Third, is a presold unit with the construction loan in the name of the buyer. We expect to have up to 8 spec loans to start the project and expect all other loans to be presold units with loans in the name of the builderdeveloper. We do not expect to have any construction loans in the name of the buyers, as such loans are too difficult to manage and please new buyers unfamiliar with the process. Spec loans will be for 70 to 75 of value and construction loans for presold units, if the construction loan is from the mortgage lender, will be from 80 to 95 of value. DISBURSEMENTS Disbursements will be handled by the General Partner to cover current and near term third party costs, then to necessary reserves, then to priority payments and then to the partners per the agreement. The General Partner will contract with Creekside Builders, LLC to construct the units and the fee to CB will include a construction management and overhead fee equal to 15 of the direct hard cost excluding land, financing and sales costs. These fees are the only monies to Creekside, Larry Lewter or myself prior to calculation of profit, except for a) direct reimbursement for partnership expenses and b) direct payment to CB for any subcontractor costs that it has to perform. For example, if CB cannot find a good trim carpenter sub, or cannot find enough trim carpenters, etc., and it decides to undertake this function, it will charge the partnership the same fee it was able to obtain from third parties and will disclose those cases to the partnership. Finally, CB will receive a fee for the use of any of its equipment if it is used in lieu of leasing equipment from others. At present CB does not own any significant equipment, but it is considering the purchase of a sky track to facilitate and speed up framing, cornice, roofing and drywall spreading.

      "page_content='passage: LAND OWNERSHIP & LOANS The property would be purchased in the name of the limited partnership and any land loans, land improvements loans and construction loans would be in the name of the limited partnership. Each of the individual investors and all of the principals in Creekside would also personally guarantee the loans. If the investor(s) do not sign on the loans, this generally means that a larger amount of cash is required and the investors share of profits is reduced. All loans for residential construction, that are intended for resale, are full recourse loans. If we are pursuing multifamily rental developments, the construction loans are still full recourse but the mortgage can often be nonrecourse. USE OF INITIAL INVESTMENT The initial investment is used for land deposit, engineering & architectural design, soils tests, surveys, filing fees, legal fees for organization and condominium association formation, and appraisals. Unlike many real estate investment programs, none of the funds are used for fees to Creekside Builders, LLC. These professional expenses will be incurred over the estimated 6 month design and approval period. EARLY LAND COSTS The 4,000 per month costs listed in the cash flow as part of land cost represent the extension fees due to the seller for up to 4 months of extensions on closing. As an alternative, we can close into a land loan at probably 70 of appraised value. With a land value equal to the purchase price of 680,000 this would mean a land loan of 476,000 with estimated monthly interest payments of 3,966, given a 10 annual interest rate, plus approximately 1.25 of the loan amount for closing costs and loan fees. EQUITY AT IMPROVEMENT LOAN Once the site plan is approved by the City of Austin, the City will require the development entity to post funds for fiscal improvements, referred to as the fiscals. This cost represents a bond for the completion of improvements that COA considers vital and these funds are released once the improvements have been completed and accepted by COA. This release will be for 90 of the cost with the remaining 10 released one year after completion. Releases can be granted once every 90 days and you should expect that the release would occur 6 months after the start of lot improvement construction. These fiscals are usually posted in cash or an irrevocable letter of credit. As such, they have to be counted as a development cost, even though they are not spent. Because they are not spent no interest is charged on these funds. The lot improvement loan is typically 75 of the appraised value of a finished lot, which I suspect will be at least 20,000 and potentially as high as 25,000. This would produce a loan amount of 15,000 on 20,000 per lot. With estimated per lot improvement costs of 9,000, fiscals at 2,000 and the land cost at 8,000 , total improved lot cost is 19,000 which means 0 to 4,000 per lot in total equity. The investment prior to obtaining the improvement loan would count towards any equity requirement provided it was for direct costs. Thus, the additional equity for the improvement loan would be 0184,000. Even if the maximum loan would cover all costs, it is unlikely the bank would allow reimbursement of funds spent. The higher estimates of equity investments are shown in the preliminary proforma to be on the safe side. The engineer is preparing a tentative site layout with an initial evaluation of the phasing, which can significantly reduce the cash equity requirement. Phasing works as follows. If the first phase was say 40 units, the total lot improvement cost might average 31,000 per lot. Of this, probably 13,000 would be for improvements and 19,000 for the land cost. The improvements are higher to cover large one time up front costs for design costs, the entry road, water treatment costs, perimeter fencing and landscaping, and so on, as well as for 100 of the land. The land loan for undeveloped lots would be 70 of the appraised raw lot value, which I would estimate as 10,000 per lot for a loan value of 7,000 per lot. Then the loan value for each improved lot would be 15,000 per lot. This would give you a total loan of 992,000, total cost of 1,232,645 for equity required of 241,000.

As you can tell from the proforma this project should produce a truly exceptional return of over 40 per year over 3 years. This is especially attractive when the project is in a market as strong as Austin and we are introducing new product that in a very low price range for this market. This is the best project in terms of risk and reward that we have uncovered to date in the Austin market. The project does have approved zoning and will only require a site plan. As it is in the Smart Growth Corridor area designated by the City of Austin for preferred development, this will be fast tracked and should be complete in less than 6 months. Additionally, many of the current and more severe water treatment ordinances have been waived. I have estimated the lot improvement costs based on a 28 lot development we investigated in North Austin, which included a detentionretention and filtration pond and street widening. Even though this property is not likely to require street widening and will have less of a detentionretention and filtration pond requirement, I used this data to be cautious. The Lone Star gas line easement in the lower portion of the property is not expected to impact sales significantly. Other projects have been quite successful with identical relationships to this pipeline, such as the adjoining single family residential and a project at St. Edwards University. As with most infill projects, the quality of the surrounding neighborhoods is uneven. We have included a fence around the entire property, but may only put it on Westgate and Cameron Loop. Gated communities are far preferred so this is a good idea for both screening and current buyer preferences. The seller accepted our offer Thursday evening with a price of 680,000 and an extended escrow. This will enable us to probably obtain an approved site plan before closing on the contract, which will mean that we can close into an A&D Loan rather than into a land loan and then an improvement loan. This analysis shows your investment at 700,000 for a 50 interest in the profits of the project. As we discussed in San Marcos, we can also discuss having you invest only in the lots, sell the lots to the construction entity with your profit in the lot. I believe this would facilitate the use of a 1031 Exchange of the proceeds from this deal into another project that is a rental deal or at least into the land for a rental project that would then be the equity for that project. You would need to discuss this with an exchange expert first. Larry Lewter knows an expert in the field in San Antonio if you do not know anyone. I will send you a package on the property that was prepared by the broker, by Airborne Express today for Saturday delivery. Once you have read the package and reviewed this proforma, we would want to schedule a tour of the site and the area.

We do not know the exact size of each of his units, but we believe one of the duplexes is a 11641302 sq ft. plan. This would produce an average sq footage of 1233, which would be 73.80 psf at 182,000. (I thought his sales price was 187,000.) At this price psf our 1,376 sf unit would sell for 203,108.

The seller accepted our offer Thursday evening with a price of 680,000 and an extended escrow. This will enable us to probably obtain an approved site plan before closing on the contract, which will mean that we can close into an A&D Loan rather than into a land loan and then an improvement loan. This analysis shows your investment at 700,000 for a 50 interest in the profits of the project. As we discussed in San Marcos, we can also discuss having you invest only in the lots, sell the lots to the construction entity with your profit in the lot. I believe this would facilitate the use of a 1031 Exchange of the proceeds from this deal into another project that is a rental deal or at least into the land for a rental project that would then be the equity for that project. You would need to discuss this with an exchange expert first. Larry Lewter knows an expert in the field in San Antonio if you do not know anyone. I will send you a package on the property that was prepared by the broker, by Airborne Express today for Saturday delivery. Once you have read the package and reviewed this proforma, we would want to schedule a tour of the site and the area. Please get back to me as soon as your schedule permits regarding the site visit and feel free to call at any time. You can reach me over the weekend and in the evening at either 5123381119 or 5123381110. My cell phone is 5127487495 and the fax is 5123381103.

The mission was to handle the Internet traffic and computer servers for the regions growing number of dotcoms. Fastforward to summer 2000. Exodus is now wrapping up construction on a new 13acre, 576,000squarefoot data center less than a mile from its original facility. Sitting at the confluence of several fiber optic backbones, the Exodus plant will consume enough power for a small town and eventually house Internet servers for firms such as Avenue A, Microsoft and Onvia.com. Exodus is not the only company building massive data centers near Seattle. More than a dozen companies with names like AboveNet, Globix and HostPro are looking for facilities here that will house the networking equipment of the Internet economy. It is a big business that could have an effect on everything from your monthly electric bill to the ease with which you access your favorite Web sites. Data centers, also known as colocation facilities and server farms, are sprouting at such a furious pace in Tukwila and the Kent Valley that some have expressed concern over whether Seattle City Light and Puget Sound Energy can handle the power necessary to run these 24hour, highsecurity facilities. We are talking to about half a dozen customers that are requesting 445 megawatts of power in a little area near Southcenter Mall, said Karl Karzmar, manager of revenue requirements for Puget Sound Energy. That is the equivalent of six oil refineries. A relatively new phenomenon in the utility business, the rise of the Internet data center has some utility veterans scratching their heads. Puget Sound Energy last week asked the Washington Utilities and Transportation Commission to accept a tariff on the new data centers. The tariff is designed to protect the companys existing residential and business customers from footing the bill for the new base stations necessary to support the projects. Those base stations could cost as much as 20 million each, Karzmar said. Not to be left behind, Seattle City Light plans to bring up the data center issue on Thursday at the Seattle City Council meeting. For the utilities that provide power to homes, businesses and schools in the region, this is a new and complex issue.' metadata={'sender': 'phillip.allen@enron.com', 'recipient': 'thomas.martin@enron.com, mike.grigsby@enron.com, keith.holst@enron.com, jay.reitmeyer@enron.com, frank.ermis@enron.com', 'date': 'Wed, 6 Sep 2000 04:46:00 -0700', 'subject': 'Wow'}\n",
      "page_content='passage: On one hand, the data centers with their amazing appetite for power represent potentially lucrative business customers. The facilities run 24 hours a day, seven days a week, and therefore could become a constant revenue stream. On the other hand, they require so much energy that they could potentially flood the utilities with exorbitant capital expenditures. Who will pay for those expenditures and what it will mean for power rates in the area is still open to debate. These facilities are what we call extremely dense loads, said Bob Royer, director of communications and public affairs at Seattle City Light. The entire University of Washington, from stadium lights at the football game to the Medical School, averages 31 megawatts per day. We have data center projects in front of us that are asking for 30, 40 and 50 megawatts. With more than 1.5 million square feet, the Intergate complex in Tukwila is one of the biggest data centers. Sabey Corp. repurchased the 1.35 million squarefoot Intergate East facility last September from Boeing Space & Defense. In less than 12 months, the developer has leased 92 percent of the sixbuilding complex to seven different colocation companies. It is probably the largest data center park in the country, boasts Laurent Poole, chief operating officer at Sabey. Exodus, ICG Communications, NetStream Communications, Pac West Telecomm and Zama Networks all lease space in the office park. After building Exodus first Tukwila facility in 1997, Sabey has become an expert in the arena and now has facilities either under management or development in Los Angeles, Spokane and Denver. Poole claims his firm is one of the top four builders of Internet data centers in the country. As more people access the Internet and conduct bandwidthheavy tasks such as listening to online music, Poole said the need for colocation space in Seattle continues to escalate. But it is not just Seattle. The need for data center space is growing at a rapid clip at many technology hubs throughout the country, causing similar concerns among utilities in places such as Texas and California. Exodus, one of the largest providers of colocation space, plans to nearly double the amount of space it has by the end of the year. While companies such as Amazon.com run their own server farms, many hightech companies have decided to outsource the operations to companies such as Exodus that may be better prepared for dealing with Internet traffic management. We have 2 million square feet of space under construction and we plan to double our size in the next nine months , yet there is more demand right now than data center space, said Steve Porter, an account executive at Exodus in Seattle. The booming market for colocation space has left some in the local utility industry perplexed. It accelerates in a quantum way what you have to do to serve the growth, said Seattle City Lights Royer. The utility industry is almost stunned by this, in a way.' metadata={'sender': 'phillip.allen@enron.com', 'recipient': 'thomas.martin@enron.com, mike.grigsby@enron.com, keith.holst@enron.com, jay.reitmeyer@enron.com, frank.ermis@enron.com', 'date': 'Wed, 6 Sep 2000 04:46:00 -0700', 'subject': 'Wow'}\n",

We appreciate your prompt attention and completing the Team Selection information. Ideally, we needed to receive your team of raters on the Team Selection form we sent you. The information needed is then easily transferred into the database directly from that Excel spreadsheet. If you do not have the ability to complete that form, inserting what you listed below, we still require additional information. We need each persons email address. Without the email address, we cannot email them their internet link and ID to provide feedback for you, nor can we send them an automatic reminder via email. It would also be good to have each persons phone number, in the event we need to reach them. So, we do need to receive that complete TS Excel spreadsheet, or if you need to instead, provide the needed information via email.

The WSCC data, which is dicey and we dont have until July 1999, and the CEMMS, which comes on a delay, are ultimately our best sources. For your purposes the CAISO may suffice. I think that you probably know this already, but there can be a siginificant difference between scheduled and actual generation. You are pulling scheduled. If someone doesnt schedule their generation and then generates, either instructed or uninstructed, then you will miss that. You may also miss generation of the northern california munis such as smud who only schedule their net load to the caiso. That is, if they have 1500 MW of load and 1200 MW of generation, they may simply schedule 300 MW of load and sc transfers or imports of 300 MW. Having said all of that, it is probably close enough and better than your alternatives on the generation side. On the load side I think that I would simply use CAISO actual load. While they dont split out NP15 from SP15, I think that using the actual number is better than the scheduled number. The utilities play lots of game on the load side, usually underscheduling depending on price. I think the presentation looks good. It would be useful to share this with others up here once you have it finished. Id like to see how much gas demand goes up with each additional GW of gasgenerated electricity, especially compared to all gas consumption. I was surprised by how small the UEG consumption was compared to other uses. If it is the largest marginal consumer then it is obviously a different story.' metadata={'sender': 'phillip.allen@enron.com', 'recipient': 'matthew.lenhart@enron.com', 'date': 'Mon, 12 Jun 2000 03:56:00 -0700', 'subject': 'Thoughts on Presentation'}\n",

Also, if you want me to get with Kim and the Sitara people to change the mapping, let me know and Ill take care of it.. On PG&E NW, it appears that PGEN Kingsgate is mapped to a Malin Citygate curve instead of a Kingsgate curve, resulting in a total transport loss of 235,019. (If the mapping were changed, it should just reallocate p&lnot change your overall p&l.) Maybe there is a reason for this mapping or maybe it affects something else somewhere that I am not seeing, but anyway, here are the Deal s, paths and p&l impacts of each. 139195 From Kingsgate to Malin (182,030) 139196 From Kingsgate to PGENTuscarora ( 4,024) 139197 From Kingsgate to PGEN Malin ( 8,271) 231321 From Kingsgate to Malin ( 38,705) 153771 From Kingsgate to Stanfield ( 1,988) Suggested fix: Change PGEN Kingsgate mapping from GDPMalin Citygate to GDPKingsgate. Clay Basin storagethis is really a FYI more than anything elseI see five different tickets in Sitara for Clay Basin activityone appears to be for withdrawals and the other four are injections. Clay Basin is valued as a Questar curve, which is substantially below NWPL points. What this means is that any time you are injecting gas, these tickets will show transport losses; each time you are withdrawing, you will show big gains on transport. Im not sure of the best way to handle this since we dont really have a systematic Sitara way of handling storage deals. In an ideal world, it seems that you would map it the way you have it today, but during injection times, the transport cost would pass through as storage costs. Anyway, heres the detail on the tickets just for your info, plus I noticed three days where it appears we were both withdrawing and injecting from Clay Basin. There may be an operational reason why this occurred that Im not aware of, and the dollar impact is very small, but I thought Id bring it to your attention just in case theres something you want to do about it.

Never say never, but I think it is highly unlikely that the final order will contain a fixed price cap. I base this belief in large part on what I heard at a luncheon I attended yesterday afternoon at which the keynote speaker was FERC Chairman Curt Hebert. Although the Chairman began his presentation by expressly stating that he would not comment or answer questions on pending proceedings before the Commission, Hebert had some enlightening comments which relate to price caps: Price caps are almost never the right answer Price Caps will have the effect of prolonging shortages Competitive choices for consumers is the right answer Any solution, however short term, that does not increase supply or reduce demand, is not acceptable Eight out of eleven western Governors oppose price caps, in that they would export Californias problems to the West This is the latest intelligence I have on the matter, and its a pretty strong anti price cap position. Of course, Hebert is just one Commissioner out of 3 currently on the Commission, but he controls the meeting agenda and if the draft order is not to his liking, the item could be bumped off the agenda.' metadata={'sender': 'phillip.allen@enron.com', 'recipient': 'john.lavorato@enron.com', 'date': 'Wed, 25 Apr 2001 16:52:00 -0700', 'subject': \"Re: This morning's Commission meeting delayed\"}\n",

They were polite regarding asset management and procurement function outsourcing and are willing to listen to a proposal. However, they are very interested in weather hedges to protect throughput related earnings. We are pursuing a confidentiality agreement with them to facilitate the sharing of information that will enable us to develop proposals. Our pitch was based upon enhancing shareholder value by outsourcing a nonprofit and costly function (procurement) and by reducing the volatility of their earnings by managing throughput via a weather product. As to your other question. We have yet to identify or pursue other candidates; however, Mike McDonald and I are developing a coverage strategy to ensure that we meet with all potential entities and investigate our opportunities.

This will be difficult as there is no clear mandate from their commissions as to what an acceptable portfolio (fixed, indexed, collars....) should look like. Offering them a guaranteed discount to the 1st of month index may not be attractive unless we accept their regulatory risk. That risk may not be acceptable to the desk.

Bridge Loan Financing Bills May Not Meet Their May 8th Deadline Due to Lack of Support Sources report there will not be a vote regarding the authorization for the bond issuancebridge loan by the May 8th deadline. Any possibility for a deal has reportedly fallen apart. According to sources, both the Republicans and Democratic caucuses are turning against Davis. The Democratic caucus is reportedly unwilling to fight for Davis. Many legislative Republicans and Democrats reportedly do not trust Davis and express concern that, once the bonds are issued to replenish the General Fund, Davis would double dip into the fund. Clearly there is a lack of good faith between the legislature and the governor. However, it is believed once Davis discloses the details of the power contracts negotiated, a bond issuance will take place. Additionally, some generator sources have reported that some of the longterm power contracts (as opposed to those still in development) require that the bond issuance happen by July 1, 2001. If not, the state may be in breach of contract. Sources state that if the legislature does not pass the bridge loan legislation by May 8th, having a bond issuance by July 1st will be very difficult. The Republicans were planning to offer an alternative plan whereby the state would eat the 5 billion cost of power spent to date out of the General Fund, thereby decreasing the amount of the bond issuance to approximately 8 billion. However, the reportedly now are not going to offer even this concession. Sources report that the Republicans intend to hold out for full disclosure of the governors plan for handling the crisis, including the details and terms of all longterm contracts he has negotiated, before they will support the bond issuance to go forward. Currently there are two bills dealing with the bridge loan; AB 8X and AB 31X. AB 8X authorizes the DWR to sell up to 10 billion in bonds. This bill passed the Senate in March, but has stalled in the Assembly due to a lack of Republican support. AB 31X deals with energy conservation programs for community college districts. However, sources report this bill may be amended to include language relevant to the bond sale by Senator Bowen, currently in AB 8X. Senator Bowens language states that the state should get paid before the utilities from rate payments (which, if passed, would be likely to cause a SoCal bankruptcy). According to sources close to the Republicans in the legislature, Republicans do not believe there should be a bridge loan due to money available in the General Fund. For instance, Tony Strickland has stated that only 12 of the bonds (or approximately 5 billion) should be issued. Other Republicans reportedly do not support issuing any bonds. The Republicans intend to bring this up in debate on Monday. Additionally, Lehman Brothers reportedly also feels that a bridge loan is unnecessary and there are some indications that Lehman may back out of the bridge loan. Key Points of the Bridge Financing Initial Loan Amount: 4.125 B Lenders: JP Morgan 2.5 B Lehman Brothers 1.0 B Bear Stearns 625 M Tax Exempt Portion: Of the 4.125 B; 1.6 B is expected to be taxexempt Projected Interest Rate: Taxable Rate 5.77 TaxExempt Rate 4.77 Current Projected Blended IR: 5.38 Maturity Date: August 29, 2001 For more details please contact me at (713) 8539510 Bill SB 6X Passed the Senate Yesterday, but Little Can be Done at This Time The Senate passed SB 6X yesterday, which authorizes 5 billion to create the California Consumer Power and Conservation Authority. The 5 billion authorized under SB 6X is not the same as the 5 billion that must be authorized by the legislature to pay for power already purchased, or the additional amount of bonds that must be authorized to pay for purchasing power going forward.' metadata={'sender': 'phillip.allen@enron.com', 'recipient': 'keith.holst@enron.com', 'date': 'Sun, 6 May 2001 23:54:00 -0700', 'subject': 'California Update 5/4/01'}\n",

      "page_content='passage: However, this can be considered a victory for consumer advocates, who began promoting this idea earlier in the crisis. SoCal Edison and Bankruptcy At this point, two events would be likely to trigger a SoCal bankruptcy. The first would be a legislative rejection of the MOU between SoCal and the governor. The specified deadline for legislative approval of the MOU is August 15th, however, some decision will likely be made earlier. According to sources, the state has yet to sign the MOU with SoCal, though SoCal has signed it. The Republicans are against the MOU in its current form and Davis and the Senate lack the votes needed to pass. If the legislature indicates that it will not pas the MOU, SoCal would likely file for voluntary bankruptcy (or its creditor involuntary) due to the lack operating cash. The second likely triggering event, which is linked directly to the bond issuance, would be an effort by Senator Bowen to amend SB 31X (bridge loan) stating that the DWR would received 100 of its payments from ratepayers, then the utilities would receive the residual amount. In other words, the state will get paid before the utilities. If this language is included and passed by the legislature, it appears likely that SoCal will likely file for bankruptcy. SoCal is urging the legislature to pay both the utilities and the DWR proportionately from rate payments.' metadata={'sender': 'phillip.allen@enron.com', 'recipient': 'keith.holst@enron.com', 'date': 'Sun, 6 May 2001 23:54:00 -0700', 'subject': 'California Update 5/4/01'}\n",

Never say never, but I think it is highly unlikely that the final order will contain a fixed price cap. I base this belief in large part on what I heard at a luncheon I attended yesterday afternoon at which the keynote speaker was FERC Chairman Curt Hebert. Although the Chairman began his presentation by expressly stating that he would not comment or answer questions on pending proceedings before the Commission, Hebert had some enlightening comments which relate to price caps: Price caps are almost never the right answer Price Caps will have the effect of prolonging shortages Competitive choices for consumers is the right answer Any solution, however short term, that does not increase supply or reduce demand, is not acceptable Eight out of eleven western Governors oppose price caps, in that they would export Californias problems to the West This is the latest intelligence I have on the matter, and its a pretty strong anti price cap position. Of course, Hebert is just one Commissioner out of 3 currently on the Commission, but he controls the meeting agenda and if the draft order is not to his liking, the item could be bumped off the agenda.' metadata={'sender': 'phillip.allen@enron.com', 'recipient': 'john.lavorato@enron.com', 'date': 'Wed, 25 Apr 2001 06:52:00 -0700', 'subject': \"Re: This morning's Commission meeting delayed\"}\n",

Your intuition as to reductions seen so far (e.g., March 2001 vs.' metadata={'sender': 'phillip.allen@enron.com', 'recipient': 'mike.grigsby@enron.com', 'date': 'Tue, 10 Apr 2001 10:51:00 -0700', 'subject': 'CAISO demand reduction'}\n",
      "page_content='passage: March 2000) was absolutely correct. At this point, it appears that demand over the last 12 months in the CAISO control area, after adjusting for temperature and time of use factors, has fallen by about 6. This translates into a reduction of about 1,5001,600 MWa for last month (March 2001) as compared with the previous year. Looking forward into the summer, I believe that we will see further voluntary reductions (as opposed to forced reductions via rolling blackouts). Other forecasters (e.g., PIRA) are estimating that another 1,2001,300 MWa (making total yearonyear reduction 2,7002,800) will come off starting in June. This scenario is not difficult to imagine, as it would require only a couple more percentage points reduction in overall peak demand. Given that the 6 decrease we have seen so far has come without any real price signals to the retail market, and that rates are now scheduled to increase, I think that it is possible we could see peak demand fall by as much as 10 relative to last year. This would mean peak demand reductions of approx 3,3003,500 MWa in JunAug. In addition, a number of efforts aimed specifically at conservation are being promoted by the State, which can only increase the likelihood of meeting, and perhaps exceeding, the 3,500 MWa figure. Finally, the general economic slowdown in Calif could also further depress demand, or at least make the 3,500 MWa number that much more attainable. Note that all the numbers I am reporting here are for the CAISO control area only, which represents about 89 of total Calif load, or 3637 of WSCC (U.S.) summer load. I think it is reasonable to assume that the nonISO portion of Calif (i.e., LADWP and IID) will see similar reductions in demand. As for the rest of the WSCC, that is a much more difficult call. As you are aware, the Pacific NW has already seen about 2,000 MWa of aluminum smelter load come off since Dec, and this load is expected to stay off at least through Sep, and possibly for the next couple of years (if BPA gets its wish). This figure represents approx 4 of the nonCalif WSCC. Several mining operations in the SW and Rockies have recently announced that they are sharply curtailing production. I have not yet been able to pin down exactly how many MW this translates to, but I will continue to research the issue. Other large industrials may follow suit, and the ripple effects from Califs economic slowdown could be a factor throughout the West. While the rest of the WSCC may not see the 10 reductions that I am expecting in Calif, I think we could easily expect an additional 23 (on top of the 4 already realized), or approx 1,0001,500 MWa, of further demand reduction in the nonCalif WSCC for this summer. This would bring the total reduction for the WSCC, including the 2,000 MWa aluminum load we have already seen, to around 6,5007,000 MWa when compared with last summer. I am continuing to research and monitor the situation, and will provide you with updates as new or better information becomes available.' metadata={'sender': 'phillip.allen@enron.com', 'recipient': 'mike.grigsby@enron.com', 'date': 'Tue, 10 Apr 2001 10:51:00 -0700', 'subject': 'CAISO demand reduction'}\n",

The cost for the new garage will be the same as Allen Center garage which is currently 165.00 per month, less the company subsidy, leaving a monthly employee cost of 94.00. If you choose not to accept this offer at this time, you may add your name to the Enron Center garage waiting list at a later day and offers will be made as spaces become available. The Saturn Ring that connects the garage and both buildings will not be opened until summer 2001. All initial parkers will have to use the street level entrance to Enron Center North until Saturn Ring access is available. Garage stairways next to the elevator lobbies at each floor may be used as an exit in the event of elevator trouble. If you are interested in accepting this offer, please reply via email to Parking and Transportation as soon as you reach a decision. Following your email, arrangements will be made for you to turn in your old parking card and receive a parking transponder along with a new information packet for the new garage.

I have received estimates structured as follows: 5 onsite expenses, supervision, clean up, equipment 2 overhead 4 profit I just wanted to give you this initial feedback. I have also attached an extremely primitive spreadsheet to outline the project. As you can see even reducing the builders fees to the numbers above the project would only generate 219,194 of cash flow for a return of 21. I am not thrilled about such a low return.

Restructure or Buyout Dear Phillip and Keith: We are prepared to sell Bishops Corner, Ltd. for reimbursement of our cash expenditures; compensation for our management services and your assumption of all note obligations and design contracts.? As shown on the attached summary table, cash expenditures total 21,196 and existing contracts to the architect, civil engineer, soils testing company, and appraisal total 67,050.? The due on these contracts is 61,175, of which current unpaid invoices due total 37,325. Acting in good faith, we have invested an enormous amount of time into this project for more than five months and have completed most of the major design and other preconstruction elements.? As it is a major project for a firm of our size, it was given top priority with other projects being delayed or rejected, and we are now left with no project to pursue.? Two methods for valuing this development management are 1) based on a percentage of the minimum 1.4MM fee we were to have earned and 2) based on your prior valuation of our time.? For the first, we feel that at least 25, or 350,000, of the minimum 1.4MM fee has been earned to date.? For the second, in your prior correspondence you valued our time at 500,000 per year, which would mean this period was worth 208,333.? Either of these valuations seem quite fair and reasonable, especially as neither includes the forfeit of our 40 interest in the project worth 0.81.2MM. ?However, in the hope that we can maintain a good relationship with the prospect of future projects, we are willing to accept only a small monthly fee of 15,000 per month to cover a portion of our direct time and overhead.? As shown in the attached table, this fee, plus cash outlays and less accrued interest brings the total net buyout to 78,946.? We still believe that this project needs the professional services that we offer and have provided.? However, if you accept the terms of this buyout offer, which we truly feel is quite fair and reasonable, then, we are prepared to be bought out and leave this extraordinary project to you both.? If this is your choice, either contact us, or have your attorney contact our attorney, Claudia Crocker, no later than Friday of this week.? The attorneys can then draft whatever minimal documents are necessary for the transfer of the Bishops Corner, Ltd. Partnership to you following receipt of the buyout amount and assumption of the outstanding professional design contracts. Thank you. ?

Hugo has completed a platt to combine into one lot and is ready to submit it to the city of San Marcos. He has also completed a topographical survey and a tree survey. In addition, he has begun to coordinate with the city on the replatting and a couple of easements on the smaller parcel, as well as, beginning the work on the grading. Hugo is going to fax me a written letter of the scope of work he has been engaged to complete. The total cost of his services are estimated at 38,000 of which 14,000 are due now for work completed. We are trying to resolve the issues of outstanding work and bills incurred by the original developer so we can obtain the title to the land. If we can continue to use Cuatro then it would be one less point of contention. Hugos number is 5122958052.

Restructure or Buyout Dear Phillip and Keith: We are prepared to sell Bishops Corner, Ltd. for reimbursement of our cash expenditures; compensation for our management services and your assumption of all note obligations and design contracts.? As shown on the attached summary table, cash expenditures total 21,196 and existing contracts to the architect, civil engineer, soils testing company, and appraisal total 67,050.? The due on these contracts is 61,175, of which current unpaid invoices due total 37,325. Acting in good faith, we have invested an enormous amount of time into this project for more than five months and have completed most of the major design and other preconstruction elements.? As it is a major project for a firm of our size, it was given top priority with other projects being delayed or rejected, and we are now left with no project to pursue.? Two methods for valuing this development management are 1) based on a percentage of the minimum 1.4MM fee we were to have earned and 2) based on your prior valuation of our time.? For the first, we feel that at least 25, or 350,000, of the minimum 1.4MM fee has been earned to date.? For the second, in your prior correspondence you valued our time at 500,000 per year, which would mean this period was worth 208,333.? Either of these valuations seem quite fair and reasonable, especially as neither includes the forfeit of our 40 interest in the project worth 0.81.2MM. ?However, in the hope that we can maintain a good relationship with the prospect of future projects, we are willing to accept only a small monthly fee of 15,000 per month to cover a portion of our direct time and overhead.? As shown in the attached table, this fee, plus cash outlays and less accrued interest brings the total net buyout to 78,946.? We still believe that this project needs the professional services that we offer and have provided.? However, if you accept the terms of this buyout offer, which we truly feel is quite fair and reasonable, then, we are prepared to be bought out and leave this extraordinary project to you both.? If this is your choice, either contact us, or have your attorney contact our attorney, Claudia Crocker, no later than Friday of this week.? The attorneys can then draft whatever minimal documents are necessary for the transfer of the Bishops Corner, Ltd. Partnership to you following receipt of the buyout amount and assumption of the outstanding professional design contracts. Thank you. ?

Upon receipt of all the requested information regarding the project, we completed somewhat of a due diligence on the market. There are a number of concerns which need to be addressed prior to the Bank moving forward on the transaction. First, the proforma rental rates, when compared on a Bedroom to Bedroom basis, are high relative to the market. We adjusted proforma downward to match the market rates and the rates per bedroom we are acheiving on the existing Sagewood project. Additionally, there are about 500 units coming online within the next 12 months in the City of San Marcos, this, we believe will causes some downward rent pressures which can have a serious effect on an over leveraged project. We have therefore adjusted the requested loan amount to 8,868,000. I have summarized our issues as follows: 1. Proforma rental rates were adjusted downward to market as follows: ProForma Banks Adjustment Unit Unit Rent RentBR Unit Rent RentBR 2 BR2.5 BA 1,150 575 950 475 3 BRUnit 1,530 510 1,250 417 2. Proforma expenses were increased to include a 350unit reserve for unit turn over. 3. A market vacancy factor of 5 was applied to Potential Gross Income (PGI). 4.' metadata={'sender': 'phillip.allen@enron.com', 'recipient': 'gthorse@keyad.com', 'date': 'Thu, 8 Mar 2001 05:33:00 -0800', 'subject': 'Sagewood Phase II'}\n",

The components are as follows: Unit Cost, Site work, & builders profit(52sf) 7.6 million Land 1.15 Interim Financing .85 Common Areas .80 Total 10.4 Since Reagans last 12 units are selling for around 190,000, I am unable to get comfortable building a larger project at over 95,000unit in costs. Also, the comps used in the appraisal from Austin appear to be class A properties. It seems unlikely that student housing in San Marcos can produce the same rent or sales price. There should adjustments for location and the seasonal nature of student rental property. I recognize that Sagewood is currently performing at occupancy and foot rental rates that are closer to the appraisal and your pro formas, however, we do not believe that the market will sustain these levels on a permanent basis. Supply will inevitablely increase to drive this market more in balance. After the real estate expert from Houston reviewed the proforma and cost estimates, his comments were that the appraisal is overly optimistic. He feels that the permanent financing would potentially be around 9.8 million. We would not even be able to cover the interim financing. Keith and I have reviewed the project thoroughly and are in agreement that we cannot proceed with total cost estimates significantly above 10.5 million.

Also, the comps used in the appraisal from Austin appear to be class A properties. It seems unlikely that student housing in San Marcos can produce the same rent or sales price. There should adjustments for location and the seasonal nature of student rental property. I recognize that Sagewood is currently performing at occupancy and foot rental rates that are closer to the appraisal and your pro formas, however, we do not believe that the market will sustain these levels on a permanent basis. Supply will inevitablely increase to drive this market more in balance. After the real estate expert from Houston reviewed the proforma and cost estimates, his comments were that the appraisal is overly optimistic. He feels that the permanent financing would potentially be around 9.8 million. We would not even be able to cover the interim financing. Keith and I have reviewed the project thoroughly and are in agreement that we cannot proceed with total cost estimates significantly above 10.5 million. We would like to have a conference call tomorrow to discuss alternatives.' metadata={'sender': 'phillip.allen@enron.com', 'recipient': 'cbpres@austin.rr.com', 'date': 'Mon, 5 Mar 2001 07:21:00 -0800', 'subject': 'Cc: llewter@austin.rr.com, jacquestc@aol.com'}\n",

      "page_content='passage: After meeting with George and Larry, it was clear that we have different definitions of cost and profit. Their version includes the salary of a superintendent and a junior superintendent as hard costs equivalent to third party subs and materials. Then there is a layer of construction management fees of 10. There are some small incidental cost that they listed would be paid out of this money. But I think the majority of it is profit. Finally the builders profit of 1.4 million. Keith and I were not sure whether we would be open to paying the supers out of the cost or having them be paid out of the builders profit. After all, if they are the builders why does there need to be two additional supervisors? We were definitely not intending to insert an additional 10 fee in addition to the superintendent costs. George claims that all of these costs have been in the cost estimates that we have been using. I reviewed the estimates and the superintendents are listed but I dont think the construction management fee is included.

      "page_content='passage: The Los Angeles Department of Water and Power sold the ISO 1,200 megawatts of power later in the day at the wholesale electricity price cap rate of 250MWh. The LADWP, which is not governed by the ISO, needs 3,800 megawatts of power to serve its customers. It is free sell power instate above the 250MWh price cap. The LADWP has been very vocal about the amount of power it has to spare. The municipal utility has also reaped huge profits by selling its excess power into the grid when supply is tight and prices are high. However, the LADWP is named as a defendant in a civil lawsuit alleging price gouging. The suit claims the LADWP sells some of its power it gets from the federal Bonneville Power Administration, which sells hydropower at cheap rates, back into the market at prices 10 times higher. Powerex officials wouldnt comment on the ISO power sale, saying all transactions are proprietary. But the company also sold the ISO 1,000 megawatts Tuesday minutes before the ISO was to declare rolling blackouts for 1,100 a megawatthour, market sources said. The ISO, whose main job is to keep electricity flowing throughout the state no matter what the cost, started the day with a stagetwo power emergency, which means its operating reserves fell to less than 5. The ISO is having to compete with investorowned utilities in the Northwest that are willing to pay higher prices for power in a region where there are no price caps. The ISO warned federal regulators, generators and utilities Wednesday during a conference call that it would call a stagethree power emergency Wednesday, but wouldnt order rolling blackouts. A stage three is declared when the ISOs operating reserves fall to less than 1.5 and power is interrupted on a statewide basis to keep the grid from collapsing. But ISO spokesman Patrick Dorinson said it would call a stage three only as a means of attracting additional electricity resources. In order to line up (more power) we have to be in a dire situation, Dorinson said. Edison International unit (EIX) Southern California Edison, Sempra Energy unit (SRE) San Diego Gas & Electric, PG&E Corp. (PCG) unit Pacific Gas & Electric and several municipal utilities in the state will share the cost of the highpriced power. SoCal Edison and PG&E are facing a debt of more than 6 billion due to high wholesale electricity costs. The utilities debt this week could grow by nearly 1 billion, analysts said. Its still unclear whether retail customers will be forced to pay for the debt through higher electricity rates or if companies will absorb the costs.

The ISO and PUC have been inspecting all offline power plants in the state since Tuesday evening to verify that those plants are shut down for the reasons generators say they are, ISO spokesman Pat Dorinson said. About 11,000 MW of power has been off the states power grid since Monday, 7,000 MW of which is offline for unplanned maintenance, according to the ISO. The ISO manages grid reliability. As previously reported, the ISO told utilities and the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission Wednesday that it would call a stage three power alert at 5 PM PST (0100 GMT Thursday), meaning power reserves in the state would dip below 1.5 and rolling blackouts could be implemented to avoid grid collapse. However, the ISO said the action wouldnt result in rolling blackouts. The ISO and PUC also inspected Tuesday plants owned by Dynegy Inc (DYN), Reliant Energy Inc. (REI) and Southern Energy Inc (SOE). Dukes 1,500MW Moss Landing plant was also inspected by PUC representatives in June, when some units were offline for repairs, the Duke spokesman said.

(AES) and Dynegy Inc. (DYN) said Wednesday that representatives of California power officials had stopped by some of their power plants to verify that they were off line for legitimate reasons. The California Independent System Operator, which manages the states power grid and one of its wholesale power markets, and the California Public Utilities Commission began onsite inspections Tuesday night of all power plants in the state reporting that unplanned outages have forced shutdowns, ISO spokesman Pat Dorinson said. The state has had 11,000 MW off the grid since Monday, 7,000 MW for unplanned maintenance. The ISO Wednesday called a Stage 2 power emergency for the third consecutive day, meaning power reserves were below 5 and customers who agreed to cut power in exchange for reduced rates may be called on to do so. As reported earlier, Reliant Energy (REI) and Southern Energy Inc. (SOE) said they had been visited by representatives of the ISO and PUC Tuesday evening. Representatives of the two organizations also visited plants owned by AES and Dynegy Tuesday evening. AES told the visitors they couldnt perform an unannounced full inspection of the companys 450megawatt Huntington Beach power station until Wednesday morning, when the plants full staff would be present, AES spokesman Aaron Thomas said. Thomas, as well as an ISO spokesman, didnt know whether the representatives returned Wednesday for a full inspection. AES Units Down Due To Expired Emissions Credits The Huntington Beach facility and units at two other AES facilities have used up their nitrogen oxide, or NOx, emission credits. They were taken down two weeks ago in response to a request by the South Coast Air Quality Management District to stay off line until emissions controls are deployed, Thomas said. AES has about 2,000 MW, or half its maximum output, off line. The entire Huntington plant is off line, as is 1,500 MW worth of units at its Alamitos and Redondo Beach plants. The ISO has asked AES to return its off line plants to operations, but AES has refused because it is concerned the air quality district will fine the company 20 million for polluting. Wed be happy to put our units back, provided we dont get sued for it, Thomas said. Its not clear to us that the ISO trumps the air quality districts authority. As reported, a spokesman for the air quality district said Tuesday that AES could have elected to buy more emission credits so that it could run its off line plants in case of power emergencies, but choose not to do so. Dynegys El Segundo Plant Also Visited By PUC Dynegy Inc. (DYN) said the PUC visited its 1,200 MW El Segundo plant Tuesday evening, where two of the four units, about 600 MW worth, were off line Wednesday. I guess our position is, Gee, were sorry you dont believe us, but if you need to come and take a look for yourself, thats fine, said Dynegy spokesman Lynn Lednicky. Lednicky said one of the two units was off line for planned maintenance and the other for unplanned maintenance on boiler feedwater pumps, which could pose a safety hazard if not repaired. Weve been doing all we can to get back in service, Lednicky said. We even paid to have some specialized equipment expedited. Lednicky added that the PUC seemed satisfied with Dynegys explanation of why its units were off line.

Under the Plan, Capital Improvement Costs totaling 383 million are for the 20 most part being deferred to a future date. SCE dividends to its common shareholder and preferred stockholders and20 executive bonuses have been suspended, resulting in an additional cost20 savings of approximately 92 million. V. Accounting Mechanisms to Track Stranded Cost Recovery (TRA and TCBA20 Activity) Highlights: As of December 31, 2000, SCE reported an overcollected balance in the20 Transition Cost Balancing Account (TCBA) Account of 494.5 million. This20 includes an estimated market valuation of its hydro facilities of 50020 million and accelerated revenues of 175 million. As of December 31, 2000, SCE reported an undercollected balance in SCE01,s 20 Transition Account (TRA) of 4.49 billion. Normally, the generation memorandum accounts are credited to the TCBA at th e20 end of each year. However, the current generation memorandum account credit 20 balance of 1.5 billion has not been credited to the TCBA, pursuant to20 D.0101018. Costs of purchasing generation are tracked in the TRA and revenues from20 generation are tracked in the TCBA. Because these costs and revenues are20 tracked separately, the net liability from procuring electric power, as20 expressed in the TRA, are overstated. TURN Proposal As part of our review, the CPUC asked that we comment on the proposal of TU RN20 to change certain aspects of the regulatory accounting for transition asset s.20 Our comments are summarized as follows: The Proposal would have no direct impact on the cash flows of SCE in that i t20 would not directly generate nor use cash. The Proposal01,s impact on SCE01,s balance sheet would initially be to sh ift20 costs between two regulatory assets. TURN01,s proposal recognizes that because the costs of procuring power and the20 revenues from generating power are tracked separately, the undercollection in20 the TRA is overstated. VI. Flow of Funds Analysis Highlights: In the last five years, SCE had generated net income of 2.7 billion and a 20 positive cash flow from operations of 7 billion. During the same time period, SCE paid dividends and other distributions to 20 its parent, Edison International, of approximately 4.8 billion. Edison International used the funds from dividends to pay dividends to its 20 shareholders of 1.6 billion and repurchased shares of its outstanding comm on20 stock of 2.7 billion, with the remaining funds being used for administrati ve20 and general costs, investments, and other corporate purposes. there is no Section VII 20 VIII. Earnings of California Affiliates SCE01,s payments for power to its affiliates were approximately 400500 20 million annually and remained relatively stable from 1996 through 1999.20 In 2000, the payments increased by approximately 50 to over 600 million. 20 This increase correlates to the increase in market prices for natural gas for the same period.' metadata={'sender': 'phillip.allen@enron.com', 'recipient': 'mike.grigsby@enron.com, keith.holst@enron.com', 'date': 'Tue, 30 Jan 2001 23:14:00 -0800', 'subject': 'Highlights of Executive Summary by KPMG -- CPUC Audit Report on Edison'}\n",

Check my math, but it looks like all the builders profit would be recouped in the first year of operation. At permanent financing 1.1 would be paid, leaving only .3 to pay out in the 1st year. Since almost 80 of builders profit is repaid at the same time as the investment, I feel the 6535 is a fair split. However, as I mentioned earlier, I think we should negotiate to layer on additional equity to you as part of the construction contract. Just to begin the brainstorming on what a construction agreement might look like here are a few ideas: 1. Fixed construction profit of 1.4 million. Builder doesnt benefit from higher cost, rather suffers as an equity holder. 2. 5 equity for meeting time and costs in original plan (51sq ft, phase 1 complete in November) 5 equity for under budget and ahead of schedule 5 equity for over budget and behind schedule This way if things go according to plan the final split would be 6040, but could be as favorable as 5545.

Negotiations with SCE on this proposal are essentially complete. PG&E is OK with the docs. All QFs but Calpine have agreed with the IEP proposal Under the proposal, PG&E would retain 106 million (of what, Im not sure I think they mean a refund to PG&E from QFs who switched to PX pricing). The money would come from changing the basis for the QF payments from the PX price to the SRAC price, starting back in December (and maybe earlier). PG&E will not commit to a payment schedule and will not commit to take the Force Majeure notices off the table. QFs are asking IEP to attempt to get some assurances of payment. SCE has defaulted with its QFs; PG&E has not yet but big payments are due on 2201. For gasfired QFs Heat rate of 10.2 included in formula for PG&Es purchases from such QFs.

While we anticipate many new Analysts joining Enron this summer (late May) and fulltime (August) we felt it necessary to address some of the immediate needs with an OffCycle Recruiting event. We are planning this event for Thursday, February 15 and are inviting approximately 30 candidates to be interviewed. I am asking that you forward this note to any potential interviewers (Managers or above). We will conduct first round interviews in the morning and the second round interviews in the afternoon. We need for interviewers to commit either to the morning (9am12pm) or afternoon (2pm5pm) complete session. Please submit your response using the buttons below and update your calendar for this date. In addition, we will need the groups that have current needs to commit to taking one or more of these Analysts should they be extended an offer.

To do so I need a corresponding term gas price for same. Microturbine is an onsite generation product developed by Honeywell to generate electricity on customer site (degen). using natural gas. In doing so, I need your best fixed price forward gas price deal for 1, 3, 5, 7 and 10 years for annualseasonal supply to microturbines to generate fixed kWh for customer. We have the opportunity to sell customer kWh s using microturbine or sell them turbines themselves. kWh deal must have limited no risk forward gas price to make deal work. Therein comes Sempra energy gas trading, truly you. We are proposing installing 180 240 units across a large number of stores (60100) in San Diego.

The LADWP, which is not governed by the ISO, needs 3,800 megawatts of power to serve its customers. It is free sell power instate above the 250MWh price cap. The LADWP has been very vocal about the amount of power it has to spare. The municipal utility has also reaped huge profits by selling its excess power into the grid when supply is tight and prices are high. However, the LADWP is named as a defendant in a civil lawsuit alleging price gouging. The suit claims the LADWP sells some of its power it gets from the federal Bonneville Power Administration, which sells hydropower at cheap rates, back into the market at prices 10 times higher. Powerex officials wouldnt comment on the ISO power sale, saying all transactions are proprietary. But the company also sold the ISO 1,000 megawatts Tuesday minutes before the ISO was to declare rolling blackouts for 1,100 a megawatthour, market sources said. The ISO, whose main job is to keep electricity flowing throughout the state no matter what the cost, started the day with a stagetwo power emergency, which means its operating reserves fell to less than 5. The ISO is having to compete with investorowned utilities in the Northwest that are willing to pay higher prices for power in a region where there are no price caps. The ISO warned federal regulators, generators and utilities Wednesday during a conference call that it would call a stagethree power emergency Wednesday, but wouldnt order rolling blackouts. A stage three is declared when the ISOs operating reserves fall to less than 1.5 and power is interrupted on a statewide basis to keep the grid from collapsing. But ISO spokesman Patrick Dorinson said it would call a stage three only as a means of attracting additional electricity resources. In order to line up (more power) we have to be in a dire situation, Dorinson said. Edison International unit (EIX) Southern California Edison, Sempra Energy unit (SRE) San Diego Gas & Electric, PG&E Corp. (PCG) unit Pacific Gas & Electric and several municipal utilities in the state will share the cost of the highpriced power. SoCal Edison and PG&E are facing a debt of more than 6 billion due to high wholesale electricity costs. The utilities debt this week could grow by nearly 1 billion, analysts said. Its still unclear whether retail customers will be forced to pay for the debt through higher electricity rates or if companies will absorb the costs.

The ISO and PUC have been inspecting all offline power plants in the state since Tuesday evening to verify that those plants are shut down for the reasons generators say they are, ISO spokesman Pat Dorinson said. About 11,000 MW of power has been off the states power grid since Monday, 7,000 MW of which is offline for unplanned maintenance, according to the ISO. The ISO manages grid reliability. As previously reported, the ISO told utilities and the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission Wednesday that it would call a stage three power alert at 5 PM PST (0100 GMT Thursday), meaning power reserves in the state would dip below 1.5 and rolling blackouts could be implemented to avoid grid collapse. However, the ISO said the action wouldnt result in rolling blackouts. The ISO and PUC also inspected Tuesday plants owned by Dynegy Inc (DYN), Reliant Energy Inc. (REI) and Southern Energy Inc (SOE). Dukes 1,500MW Moss Landing plant was also inspected by PUC representatives in June, when some units were offline for repairs, the Duke spokesman said.

(AES) and Dynegy Inc. (DYN) said Wednesday that representatives of California power officials had stopped by some of their power plants to verify that they were off line for legitimate reasons. The California Independent System Operator, which manages the states power grid and one of its wholesale power markets, and the California Public Utilities Commission began onsite inspections Tuesday night of all power plants in the state reporting that unplanned outages have forced shutdowns, ISO spokesman Pat Dorinson said. The state has had 11,000 MW off the grid since Monday, 7,000 MW for unplanned maintenance. The ISO Wednesday called a Stage 2 power emergency for the third consecutive day, meaning power reserves were below 5 and customers who agreed to cut power in exchange for reduced rates may be called on to do so. As reported earlier, Reliant Energy (REI) and Southern Energy Inc. (SOE) said they had been visited by representatives of the ISO and PUC Tuesday evening. Representatives of the two organizations also visited plants owned by AES and Dynegy Tuesday evening. AES told the visitors they couldnt perform an unannounced full inspection of the companys 450megawatt Huntington Beach power station until Wednesday morning, when the plants full staff would be present, AES spokesman Aaron Thomas said. Thomas, as well as an ISO spokesman, didnt know whether the representatives returned Wednesday for a full inspection. AES Units Down Due To Expired Emissions Credits The Huntington Beach facility and units at two other AES facilities have used up their nitrogen oxide, or NOx, emission credits. They were taken down two weeks ago in response to a request by the South Coast Air Quality Management District to stay off line until emissions controls are deployed, Thomas said. AES has about 2,000 MW, or half its maximum output, off line. The entire Huntington plant is off line, as is 1,500 MW worth of units at its Alamitos and Redondo Beach plants. The ISO has asked AES to return its off line plants to operations, but AES has refused because it is concerned the air quality district will fine the company 20 million for polluting. Wed be happy to put our units back, provided we dont get sued for it, Thomas said. Its not clear to us that the ISO trumps the air quality districts authority. As reported, a spokesman for the air quality district said Tuesday that AES could have elected to buy more emission credits so that it could run its off line plants in case of power emergencies, but choose not to do so. Dynegys El Segundo Plant Also Visited By PUC Dynegy Inc. (DYN) said the PUC visited its 1,200 MW El Segundo plant Tuesday evening, where two of the four units, about 600 MW worth, were off line Wednesday. I guess our position is, Gee, were sorry you dont believe us, but if you need to come and take a look for yourself, thats fine, said Dynegy spokesman Lynn Lednicky. Lednicky said one of the two units was off line for planned maintenance and the other for unplanned maintenance on boiler feedwater pumps, which could pose a safety hazard if not repaired. Weve been doing all we can to get back in service, Lednicky said. We even paid to have some specialized equipment expedited.

The risk is that they have built in enough margin to give them room to manage the price risk. This is my best guess.'),\n",

We will propose to provide a full requirements supply to SW involving our control of their assets. For this to be attractive to SW, we will probably have to take on their regulatory risk on gas purchase disallowance with the commissions. This will be difficult as there is no clear mandate from their commissions as to what an acceptable portfolio (fixed, indexed, collars....) should look like. Offering them a guaranteed discount to the 1st of month index may not be attractive unless we accept their regulatory risk. That risk may not be acceptable to the desk. I will do some investigation of their PGAs and see if there is an opportunity. As to the asset management: do you have any preference on structure? Are there elements that you would like to see?

They were polite regarding asset management and procurement function outsourcing and are willing to listen to a proposal. However, they are very interested in weather hedges to protect throughput related earnings. We are pursuing a confidentiality agreement with them to facilitate the sharing of information that will enable us to develop proposals. Our pitch was based upon enhancing shareholder value by outsourcing a nonprofit and costly function (procurement) and by reducing the volatility of their earnings by managing throughput via a weather product. As to your other question. We have yet to identify or pursue other candidates; however, Mike McDonald and I are developing a coverage strategy to ensure that we meet with all potential entities and investigate our opportunities. We met with 8 entities this week (7 Municipals and SWG) as we implement our strategy in California. Are there any entities that you think would be interested in an asset management deal that we should approach? Otherwise, we intend to systematically identify and work through all the candidates.'),\n",
