To do so I need a corresponding term gas price for same. Microturbine is an onsite generation product developed by Honeywell to generate electricity on customer site (degen). using natural gas. In doing so, I need your best fixed price forward gas price deal for 1, 3, 5, 7 and 10 years for annualseasonal supply to microturbines to generate fixed kWh for customer. We have the opportunity to sell customer kWh s using microturbine or sell them turbines themselves. kWh deal must have limited no risk forward gas price to make deal work. Therein comes Sempra energy gas trading, truly you. We are proposing installing 180 - 240 units across a large number of stores (60-100) in San Diego. Store number varies because of installation hurdles face at small percent.

Then, let me know your interest level in the Westgate project? San Marcos The property across the street from the Sagewood units in San Marcos is for sale and approved for 134 units. The land is selling for 2.50 per square foot as it is one of only two remaining approved multifamily parcels in West San Marcos, which now has a moratorium on development. Several new studies we have looked at show that the rents for our duplexes and for these new units are going to be significantly higher, roughly 1.25 per square foot if leased for the entire unit on a 12-month lease and 1.30-1.40 psf if leased on a 12-month term, but by individual room. This property will have the best location for student housing of all new projects, just as the duplexes do now. If this project is of serious interest to you, please let me know as there is a very, very short window of opportunity. The equity requirement is not yet known, but it would be likely to be 300,000 to secure the land.

It appears that a single buyer entered the marketplace on both September 26 and 27 and paid above market prices (4.70-4.80) for San Juan gas. At the time of these trades, offers for physical gas at significantly (10 to 15 cents) lower prices were bypassed in order to establish higher trades to report into the index calculation. Additionally, these trades are out of line with the associated financial swaps for San Juan. We have compiled a list of financial and physical trades executed from September 25 to September 27.

      "page_content='passage: We have also included a summary of gas daily prices to illustrate the value of San Juan based on several spread relationships. The two key points from this data are as follows: 1. The high physical prices on the 26th & 27th (4.75,4,80) are much greater than the high financial trades (4.6375,4.665) on those days. 2. The spread relationship between San Juan and other points (Socal & Northwest) is consistent between the end of September and October gas daily. It doesnt make sense to have monthly indices that are dramatically different. I understand you review the trades submitted for outliers. Hopefully, the trades submitted will reveal counterparty names and you will be able to determine that there was only one buyer in the 4.70s and these trades are outliers. I wanted to give you some additional points of reference to aid in establishing a reasonable index. It is Enrons belief that the trades at 4.70 and higher were above market trades that should be excluded from the calculation of index. It is our desire to have reliable and accurate indices against which to conduct our physical and financial business. Please contact me anytime I can assist you towards this goal.

These are the complete list of trades from Enron Online (EOL), Enrons direct phone conversations, and three brokerage firms (Amerex, APB, and Prebon). Please see the attached spreadsheet for a trade by trade list and a summary. We have also included a summary of gas daily prices to illustrate the value of San Juan based on several spread relationships. The two key points from this data are as follows: 1. The high physical prices on the 26th & 27th (4.75,4,80) are much greater than the high financial trades (4.6375,4.665) on those days. 2. The spread relationship between San Juan and other points (Socal & Northwest) is consistent between the end of September and October gas daily. It doesnt make sense to have monthly indeces that are dramatically different. I understand you review the trades submitted for outliers. Hopefully, the trades submitted will reveal counterparty names and you will be able to determine that there was only one buyer in the 4.70s and these trades are outliers. I wanted to give you some additional points of reference to aid in establishing a reasonable index. It is Enrons belief that the trades at 4.70 and higher were above market trades that should be excluded from the calculation of index. It is our desire to have reliable and accurate indeces against which to conduct our physical and financial business.' metadata={'sender': 'phillip.allen@enron.com', 'recipient': 'jeffrey.hodge@enron.com', 'date': 'Thu, 28 Sep 2000 05:56:00 -0700', 'subject': 'San Juan Index'}\n",

      "page_content='passage: LAND OWNERSHIP & LOANS The property would be purchased in the name of the limited partnership and any land loans, land improvements loans and construction loans would be in the name of the limited partnership. Each of the individual investors and all of the principals in Creekside would also personally guarantee the loans. If the investor(s) do not sign on the loans, this generally means that a larger amount of cash is required and the investors share of profits is reduced. All loans for residential construction, that are intended for re-sale, are full recourse loans. If we are pursuing multifamily rental developments, the construction loans are still full recourse but the mortgage can often be non-recourse. USE OF INITIAL INVESTMENT The initial investment is used for land deposit, engineering & architectural design, soils tests, surveys, filing fees, legal fees for organization and condominium association formation, and appraisals. Unlike many real estate investment programs, none of the funds are used for fees to Creekside Builders, LLC. These professional expenses will be incurred over the estimated 6 month design and approval period. EARLY LAND COSTS The 4,000 per month costs listed in the cash flow as part of land cost represent the extension fees due to the seller for up to 4 months of extensions on closing. As an alternative, we can close into a land loan at probably 70 of appraised value. With a land value equal to the purchase price of 680,000 this would mean a land loan of 476,000 with estimated monthly interest payments of 3,966, given a 10 annual interest rate, plus approximately 1.25 of the loan amount for closing costs and loan fees. EQUITY AT IMPROVEMENT LOAN Once the site plan is approved by the City of Austin, the City will require the development entity to post funds for fiscal improvements, referred to as the fiscals. This cost represents a bond for the completion of improvements that COA considers vital and these funds are released once the improvements have been completed and accepted by COA. This release will be for 90 of the cost with the remaining 10 released one year after completion. Releases can be granted once every 90 days and you should expect that the release would occur 6 months after the start of lot improvement construction. These fiscals are usually posted in cash or an irrevocable letter of credit. As such, they have to be counted as a development cost, even though they are not spent. Because they are not spent no interest is charged on these funds. The lot improvement loan is typically 75 of the appraised value of a finished lot, which I suspect will be at least 20,000 and potentially as high as 25,000. This would produce a loan amount of 15,000 on 20,000 per lot. With estimated per lot improvement costs of 9,000, fiscals at 2,000 and the land cost at 8,000 , total improved lot cost is 19,000 which means 0 to 4,000 per lot in total equity. The investment prior to obtaining the improvement loan would count towards any equity requirement provided it was for direct costs. Thus, the additional equity for the improvement loan would be 0-184,000. Even if the maximum loan would cover all costs, it is unlikely the bank would allow reimbursement of funds spent. The higher estimates of equity investments are shown in the preliminary proforma to be on the safe side. The engineer is preparing a tentative site layout with an initial evaluation of the phasing, which can significantly reduce the cash equity requirement. Phasing works as follows. If the first phase was say 40 units, the total lot improvement cost might average 31,000 per lot. Of this, probably 13,000 would be for improvements and 19,000 for the land cost. The improvements are higher to cover large one time up front costs for design costs, the entry road, water treatment costs, perimeter fencing and landscaping, and so on, as well as for 100 of the land. The land loan for undeveloped lots would be 70 of the appraised raw lot value, which I would estimate as 10,000 per lot for a loan value of 7,000 per lot. Then the loan value for each improved lot would be 15,000 per lot. This would give you a total loan of 992,000, total cost of 1,232,645 for equity required of 241,000. This was not presented in the initial analysis as the phasing is depended on a more careful assessment by the Civil Engineer as the separate phases must each be able to stand on its own from a utility standpoint. CONSTRUCTION LOANS There are three types of construction loans. First, is a speculative (spec) loan that is taken out prior to any pre-sales activity. Second, is a construction loan for a pre-sold unit, but the loan remains in the builderdevelopers name. Third, is a pre-sold unit with the construction loan in the name of the buyer. We expect to have up to 8 spec loans to start the project and expect all other loans to be pre-sold units with loans in the name of the builderdeveloper. We do not expect to have any construction loans in the name of the buyers, as such loans are too difficult to manage and please new buyers unfamiliar with the process. Spec loans will be for 70 to 75 of value and construction loans for pre-sold units, if the construction loan is from the mortgage lender, will be from 80 to 95 of value. DISBURSEMENTS Disbursements will be handled by the General Partner to cover current and near term third party costs, then to necessary reserves, then to priority payments and then to the partners per the agreement. The General Partner will contract with Creekside Builders, LLC to construct the units and the fee to CB will include a construction management and overhead fee equal to 15 of the direct hard cost excluding land, financing and sales costs. These fees are the only monies to Creekside, Larry Lewter or myself prior to calculation of profit, except for a) direct reimbursement for partnership expenses and b) direct payment to CB for any subcontractor costs that it has to perform. For example, if CB cannot find a good trim carpenter sub, or cannot find enough trim carpenters, etc., and it decides to undertake this function, it will charge the partnership the same fee it was able to obtain from third parties and will disclose those cases to the partnership. Finally, CB will receive a fee for the use of any of its equipment if it is used in lieu of leasing equipment from others. At present CB does not own any significant equipment, but it is considering the purchase of a sky track to facilitate and speed up framing, cornice, roofing and drywall spreading.

I will go back to mine and Phillip Allens transaction?and take a look at that but as vague and general as this is I doubt that my signature? is even needed to complete this transaction.? I am in after 12 noon if there is any need to contact me regarding the closing. ? I really do not want to hold up anything or generate more work for myself and I dont want to insult or annoy anyone but this paper really doesnt seem to be something required for a closing.?

As you can tell from the proforma this project should produce a truly exceptional return of over 40 per year over 3 years. This is especially attractive when the project is in a market as strong as Austin and we are introducing new product that in a very low price range for this market. This is the best project in terms of risk and reward that we have uncovered to date in the Austin market. The project does have approved zoning and will only require a site plan. As it is in the Smart Growth Corridor area designated by the City of Austin for preferred development, this will be fast tracked and should be complete in less than 6 months. Additionally, many of the current and more severe water treatment ordinances have been waived. I have estimated the lot improvement costs based on a 28 lot development we investigated in North Austin, which included a detentionretention and filtration pond and street widening. Even though this property is not likely to require street widening and will have less of a detentionretention and filtration pond requirement, I used this data to be cautious. The Lone Star gas line easement in the lower portion of the property is not expected to impact sales significantly. Other projects have been quite successful with identical relationships to this pipeline, such as the adjoining single family residential and a project at St. Edwards University. As with most infill projects, the quality of the surrounding neighborhoods is uneven. We have included a fence around the entire property, but may only put it on Westgate and Cameron Loop. Gated communities are far preferred so this is a good idea for both screening and current buyer preferences. The seller accepted our offer Thursday evening with a price of 680,000 and an extended escrow. This will enable us to probably obtain an approved site plan before closing on the contract, which will mean that we can close into an A&D Loan rather than into a land loan and then an improvement loan. This analysis shows your investment at 700,000 for a 50 interest in the profits of the project. As we discussed in San Marcos, we can also discuss having you invest only in the lots, sell the lots to the construction entity with your profit in the lot. I believe this would facilitate the use of a 1031 Exchange of the proceeds from this deal into another project that is a rental deal or at least into the land for a rental project that would then be the equity for that project. You would need to discuss this with an exchange expert first. Larry Lewter knows an expert in the field in San Antonio if you do not know anyone. I will send you a package on the property that was prepared by the broker, by Airborne Express today for Saturday delivery. Once you have read the package and reviewed this proforma, we would want to schedule a tour of the site and the area. Please get back to me as soon as your schedule permits regarding the site visit and feel free to call at any time. You can reach me over the weekend and in the evening at either 512-338-1119 or 512-338-1110. My cell phone is 512-748-7495 and the fax is 512-338-1103.

A small freakish wind storm with severe 60mpg downdrafts hit the South part of Austin where we are building 10 town homes. One of these units had just had the roof decked with the siding scheduled to start the next day. The severe downdraft hitting the decked roof was enough to knock it down. The City shut down the project for a week and it took another week to get every thing back on tract. Then last week I had to take my wife to emergency. She has a bulge in the material between the vertebra in her spine and it causes her extreme pain and has kept her bedridden this past week..

It appears that a single buyer entered the marketplace on both September 26 and 27 and paid above market prices (4.70-4.80) for San Juan gas. At the time of these trades, offers for physical gas at significantly (10 to 15 cents) lower prices were bypassed in order to establish higher trades to report into the index calculation. Additionally, these trades are out of line with the associated financial swaps for San Juan. We have compiled a list of financial and physical trades executed from September 25 to September 27. These are the complete list of trades from Enron Online (EOL), Enrons direct phone conversations, and three brokerage firms (Amerex, APB, and Prebon).

A single buyer entered the marketplace on both September 26 and 27 and paid above market prices (4.70-4.80) for San Juan gas with the intent to distort the index. At the time of these trades, offers for physical gas at significantly (10 to 15 cents) lower prices were bypassed in order to establish higher trades to report into the index calculation. Additionally, these trades are out of line with the associated financial swaps for San Juan. We have compiled a list of financial and physical trades executed from September 25 to September 27. These are the complete list of trades from Enron Online (EOL), Enrons direct phone conversations, and three brokerage firms (Amerex, APB, and Prebon). Please see the attached spreadsheet for a trade by trade list and a summary. We have also included a summary of gas daily prices to illustrate the value of San Juan based on several spread relationships. The two key points from this data are as follows: 1. The high physical prices on the 26th & 27th (4.75,4,80) are much greater than the high financial trades (4.6375,4.665) on those days. 2. The spread relationship between San Juan and other points (Socal & Northwest) is consistent between the end of September and October gas daily. It doesnt make sense to have monthly indeces that are dramatically different. I understand you review the trades submitted for outliers. Hopefully, the trades submitted will reveal counterparty names and you will be able to determine that there was only one buyer in the 4.70s and these trades are outliers. I wanted to give you some additional points of reference to aid in establishing a reasonable index. It is Enrons belief that the trades at 4.70 and higher were above market trades that should be excluded from the calculation of index. It is our desire to have reliable and accurate indeces against which to conduct our physical and financial business.'),\n",

To do so I need a corresponding term gas price for same. Microturbine is an onsite generation product developed by Honeywell to generate electricity on customer site (degen). using natural gas. In doing so, I need your best fixed price forward gas price deal for 1, 3, 5, 7 and 10 years for annualseasonal supply to microturbines to generate fixed kWh for customer. We have the opportunity to sell customer kWh s using microturbine or sell them turbines themselves. kWh deal must have limited no risk forward gas price to make deal work. Therein comes Sempra energy gas trading, truly you. We are proposing installing 180 - 240 units across a large number of stores (60-100) in San Diego. Store number varies because of installation hurdles face at small percent. For 6-8 hours a day Microturbine run time: Gas requirement for 180 microturbines 227 - 302 MMcf per year Gas requirement for 240 microturbines 302 - 403 MMcf per year Gas will likely be consumed from May through September, during peak electric period. Gas price required: Burnertip price behind (LDC) San Diego Gas & Electric Need detail breakout of commodity and transport cost (firm or interruptible).

A single buyer entered the marketplace on both September 26 and 27 and paid above market prices (4.70-4.80) for San Juan gas with the intent to distort the index. At the time of these trades, offers for physical gas at significantly (10 to 15 cents) lower prices were bypassed in order to establish higher trades to report into the index calculation. Additionally, these trades are out of line with the associated financial swaps for San Juan. We have compiled a list of financial and physical trades executed from September 25 to September 27. These are the complete list of trades from Enron Online (EOL), Enrons direct phone conversations, and three brokerage firms (Amerex, APB, and Prebon). Please see the attached spreadsheet for a trade by trade list and a summary. We have also included a summary of gas daily prices to illustrate the value of San Juan based on several spread relationships. The two key points from this data are as follows: 1. The high physical prices on the 26th & 27th (4.75,4,80) are much greater than the high financial trades (4.6375,4.665) on those days. 2. The spread relationship between San Juan and other points (Socal & Northwest) is consistent between the end of September and October gas daily. It doesnt make sense to have monthly indeces that are dramatically different. I understand you review the trades submitted for outliers. Hopefully, the trades submitted will reveal counterparty names and you will be able to determine that there was only one buyer in the 4.70s and these trades are outliers. I wanted to give you some additional points of reference to aid in establishing a reasonable index. It is Enrons belief that the trades at 4.70 and higher were above market trades that should be excluded from the calculation of index. It is our desire to have reliable and accurate indeces against which to conduct our physical and financial business.'),\n",

To do so I need a corresponding term gas price for same. Microturbine is an onsite generation product developed by Honeywell to generate electricity on customer site (degen). using natural gas. In doing so, I need your best fixed price forward gas price deal for 1, 3, 5, 7 and 10 years for annualseasonal supply to microturbines to generate fixed kWh for customer. We have the opportunity to sell customer kWh s using microturbine or sell them turbines themselves. kWh deal must have limited no risk forward gas price to make deal work. Therein comes Sempra energy gas trading, truly you. We are proposing installing 180 - 240 units across a large number of stores (60-100) in San Diego. Store number varies because of installation hurdles face at small percent. For 6-8 hours a day Microturbine run time: Gas requirement for 180 microturbines 227 - 302 MMcf per year Gas requirement for 240 microturbines 302 - 403 MMcf per year Gas will likely be consumed from May through September, during peak electric period. Gas price required: Burnertip price behind (LDC) San Diego Gas & Electric Need detail breakout of commodity and transport cost (firm or interruptible).

      "Document: passage: Forwarded by Phillip K AllenHOUECT on 09282000 01:09 PM --------------------------- From: Phillip K Allen 09282000 10:56 AM Liane, As we discussed yesterday, I am concerned there may have been an attempt to manipulate the El Paso San Juan monthly index. It appears that a single buyer entered the marketplace on both September 26 and 27 and paid above market prices (4.70-4.80) for San Juan gas. At the time of these trades, offers for physical gas at significantly (10 to 15 cents) lower prices were bypassed in order to establish higher trades to report into the index calculation. Additionally, these trades are out of line with the associated financial swaps for San Juan. We have compiled a list of financial and physical trades executed from September 25 to September 27. These are the complete list of trades from Enron Online (EOL), Enrons direct phone conversations, and three brokerage firms (Amerex, APB, and Prebon). Please see the attached spreadsheet for a trade by trade list and a summary. {'sender': |MMR Score: 0.3766726851463318\n"

      " ```Based on the provided context, it appears that there is a concern about potential manipulation of the El Paso San Juan monthly gas index. A single buyer entered the marketplace on September 26 and 27, paying above-market prices (4.70-4.80) for San Juan gas, which may have distorted the index. This is evident from the fact that offers for physical gas at significantly lower prices (10 to 15 cents) were bypassed in order to establish higher trades to report into the index calculation.\n",
      "\n",
      "The suspicious trades are also out of line with the associated financial swaps for San Juan. Enron has compiled a list of financial and physical trades executed from September 25 to September 27, which includes data from Enron Online, direct phone conversations, and three brokerage firms (Amerex, APB, and Prebon). The attached spreadsheet provides a trade-by-trade list and a summary, highlighting the discrepancy between the high physical prices on September 26 and 27 and the high financial trades on those days.\n",
      "\n",
      "Furthermore, the spread relationship between San Juan and other points (Socal & Northwest) is consistent between the end of September and October gas daily, which suggests that the monthly indices should not be dramatically different. Enron believes that the trades at 4.70 and higher were above-market trades that should be excluded from the calculation of the index to ensure a reliable and accurate benchmark for physical and financial business.\n",
      "\n",
      "It is worth noting that Enron is taking steps to address the potential manipulation, including reviewing trades submitted for outliers and analyzing the data to determine the impact of the suspicious trades on the index. The company is also seeking to establish a reasonable index that reflects the true market value of San Juan gas. Overall, the context suggests that Enron is taking a proactive approach to identifying and addressing potential manipulation of the El Paso San Juan monthly gas index. \n",
      "\n",
      "However, without more information about the specific actions taken by Enron and the outcome of their investigation, it is difficult to say for certain whether the manipulation was successful or what the exact impact was on the index. Additionally, the context does not provide details about the identity of the single buyer or their motivations for potentially manipulating the index. Therefore, while the context provides some insight into the potential manipulation of the El Paso San Juan monthly gas index, further information would be needed to fully understand the situation.```\n",
