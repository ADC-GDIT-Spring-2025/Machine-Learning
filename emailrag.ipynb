( i thought his sales price was $ 187, 000. ) at this price psf our 1, 376 sf unit would sell for $ 203, 108. what is more important, in my view, is a ) the rental rate and b ) the rent - ability. you have all of our current rental and cost data for your own evaluation. as for rent - ability, i believe that we have shown that the 3 - bedroom, 3. 5 bath is strongly preferred in this market. in fact, if we were able to purchase additional lots from regan we would build 4 bedroom units along with the 3 - bedroom plan. phillip, i will call you today to go over this more thoroughly. sincerely, george w. richards creekside builders, llc\n",
